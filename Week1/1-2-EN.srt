1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:04,420
In this video I will give you little bit
more insight into the syllabus

2
00:00:04,421 --> 00:00:07,151
of EX101x - what are we going to do
together.

3
00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:11,840
Well, we're going to work on data analysis
- I guess you understood so much -

4
00:00:11,841 --> 00:00:14,213
but I will tell you what we will do: in
the first

5
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:19,140
six weeks we will work with spreadsheets
only. I will teach you

6
00:00:19,141 --> 00:00:22,313
all the things you need to know about
spreadsheets - we will address

7
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:26,470
Pivot tables, array formulas, how to
test your spreadsheet,

8
00:00:26,471 --> 00:00:31,026
VLOOKUPs, all the things you need.
And some people, while I was designing

9
00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:32,300
this MOOC,

10
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:36,087
asked me the following question: why
spreadsheets? Why are you going to spend

11
00:00:37,014 --> 00:00:38,091
six weeks on spreadsheets?

12
00:00:38,091 --> 00:00:43,092
Especially in the era of big data, aren't
you supposed to be teaching those people

13
00:00:44,001 --> 00:00:47,012
Hadoop clusters or 'R'? Well, no!

14
00:00:47,012 --> 00:00:51,034
Spreadsheets are really relevant!
One of the reasons that is very important

15
00:00:51,034 --> 00:00:52,121
to teach people about spreadsheets

16
00:00:53,021 --> 00:00:56,078
is that they're very commonly used:
ninety-five percent

17
00:00:56,078 --> 00:01:00,094
of all US companies still use
spreadsheets for financial reporting.

18
00:01:00,094 --> 00:01:03,128
So if you're still doing it, you don't
have to feel bad because

19
00:01:04,028 --> 00:01:07,093
so is everyone else. Working with
spreadsheets is

20
00:01:07,093 --> 00:01:10,108
super common - 64 percent of

21
00:01:11,008 --> 00:01:15,011
workers use spreadsheets in their daily
life. This is a survey

22
00:01:15,038 --> 00:01:18,043
from the US Labor Statistics

23
00:01:18,043 --> 00:01:21,662
from 2003, so it's a little bit old but
it's still

24
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:25,890
a lot of people. And a more recent survey,
from 2009,

25
00:01:25,891 --> 00:01:28,678
showed that spreadsheets are the fourth
most common task

26
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:32,650
that people do at their job on the
computer,

27
00:01:32,651 --> 00:01:35,784
after using Internet and Word
Processing, so

28
00:01:36,369 --> 00:01:41,170
it's really, really common. And what
happens often is that spreadsheets are

29
00:01:41,171 --> 00:01:43,034
designed as a one-time solution -

30
00:01:43,034 --> 00:01:46,052
you think I'm only going to use this
spreadsheet

31
00:01:46,052 --> 00:01:49,054
for this one report. You just download
the data,

32
00:01:49,072 --> 00:01:54,100
make a graph and this is where it will
end. And often it doesn't!

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,067
You know, you have that guy at the next
desk, and he says "Oh, that's a nice report,

34
00:01:59,067 --> 00:02:03,078
can I have it as well?" Sure, you are
good colleague,

35
00:02:03,078 --> 00:02:06,277
so you email this spreadsheet to him, 
and he changes some data,

36
00:02:06,979 --> 00:02:11,085
and he adds a few worksheets, and the
spreadsheet starts leading its own life.

38
00:02:11,085 --> 00:02:14,104
And our research has shown that this is
very common - on

39
00:02:15,004 --> 00:02:18,006
average spreadsheets stay alive for five
years,

40
00:02:18,006 --> 00:02:21,105
and during their life span they are used by
12 different people.

41
00:02:22,005 --> 00:02:25,051
So this is why it's really important to
be able to design

42
00:02:25,051 --> 00:02:28,125
a good, error-free spreadsheet,
because even though you think

43
00:02:29,025 --> 00:02:32,029
it's just for you, chances are very big

44
00:02:32,065 --> 00:02:36,123
that this spreadsheet has a very long
life-span. So, that's the answer to the

45
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:37,100
question

46
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,082
why we're doing this course in spreadsheets.
