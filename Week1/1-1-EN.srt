Hello there! Welcome to EX101x,

2
00:00:03,669 --> 00:00:06,930
THE course for data analysis. My name is
Felienne

3
00:00:06,993 --> 00:00:10,098
and I will be your guide through
this course. And I like to welcome you

4
00:00:10,098 --> 00:00:15,007
not just to EX101x but also to Delft
University of Technology!

5
00:00:15,889 --> 00:00:20,000
Even though you're not here with us on
campus, doing this MOOC will still make

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,055
you part

7
00:00:21,055 --> 00:00:25,117
of the Delft family. In this building that I
normally work on the 8th floor,

8
00:00:26,017 --> 00:00:29,058
we have the Spreadsheet Lab. This is my
research group

9
00:00:29,058 --> 00:00:32,061
where we work with a bunch of people on
making spreadsheets

10
00:00:32,061 --> 00:00:35,098
easier and more fun. This week

11
00:00:35,098 --> 00:00:38,587
it's all about getting to know each
other - not just for you

12
00:00:39,469 --> 00:00:42,540
to get to know me, but also for you to
get to know

13
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,643
the edX platform. Maybe this is your first
MOOC, so we will use the exercises of this

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,730
week

15
00:00:47,739 --> 00:00:51,803
to get you familiar with the way of
submitting exercises and homework to us.

16
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:55,415
But in addition for you to get to know
me

17
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:59,764
and the edX platform, this week will also
allow me an opportunity

18
00:00:59,989 --> 00:01:03,160
to get to know you - I really want to know

19
00:01:03,161 --> 00:01:06,113
what your current data analysis tools
are. Is this you?

20
00:01:07,013 --> 00:01:10,106
Are you printing out data sheets and
colouring them with a marker in your office?

21
00:01:11,006 --> 00:01:15,070
Or maybe you use spreadsheets recreationally
and plan your vacation with it?

22
00:01:15,071 --> 00:01:19,895
I want to know. Not just for me to be
able to tailor the course towards your

23
00:01:20,058 --> 00:01:21,060
specific needs,

24
00:01:21,061 --> 00:01:25,006
but also for you to get to know each
other. It's really nice if you are on the

25
00:01:25,006 --> 00:01:25,595
forum

26
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:29,600
and you have some sense of the other
people in the course.

27
00:01:29,601 --> 00:01:32,007
This is why for this first week we are
asking you

28
00:01:32,061 --> 00:01:36,530
to take a picture of yourself and your
computer screen with your favourite 

29
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:38,083
data analysis tool on it.

30
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,493
So just open your favourite spreadsheet
or database, take your phone,

31
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:46,590
make a picture of yourself at your desk,
or as I like to call it

32
00:01:46,591 --> 00:01:49,952
an "excelfie", and send this to us so 
we can have a look

33
00:01:50,052 --> 00:01:52,889
who is on this journey with us.
