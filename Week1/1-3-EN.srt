1
00:00:00,071 --> 00:00:03,127
So in this MOOC, in all of the weeks'
videos we will use

2
00:00:04,027 --> 00:00:07,536
one running example for all of the
videos

3
00:00:07,779 --> 00:00:10,840
that you'll also work on in the exercises.
And for this week

4
00:00:11,389 --> 00:00:14,401
we are going to think about the
spreadsheet to handle

5
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:19,300
the Stock exchange. I don't make a lot
of money as a professor, so

6
00:00:19,301 --> 00:00:22,078
I have to do a little bit of investing
on the side to make ends meet.

7
00:00:23,005 --> 00:00:27,144
So I have this little spreadsheet where I have
a bunch of companies that I own some

8
00:00:27,189 --> 00:00:28,198
shares from,

9
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:32,334
and the number of shares that I own. And of
course, now I want to know

10
00:00:32,829 --> 00:00:38,649
how is my stock portfolio doing - am I
making money on it? So what I need for

11
00:00:38,649 --> 00:00:39,160
this, of course, is

12
00:00:39,165 --> 00:00:44,071
recent stock information. I need to know
what the value of all the stocks is that

13
00:00:44,071 --> 00:00:46,087
I have. So what I can do for that -

14
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:49,587
let me make a new worksheet and go to
the DATA tab,

15
00:00:50,046 --> 00:00:53,626
and there's a button right there, maybe
you've never seen it or used it, it's

16
00:00:54,003 --> 00:00:55,563
called "Get External Data".

17
00:00:56,009 --> 00:01:00,010
And with this button I can get data
into my spreadsheet

18
00:01:00,019 --> 00:01:03,037
from virtually everywhere. Let me 
show you

19
00:01:03,037 --> 00:01:06,737
how that works. So you click the button
and you select

20
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:11,057
"From Web". And what happens is that Excel
opens this little browser, just a normal

21
00:01:11,057 --> 00:01:12,597
internet browser,

22
00:01:13,001 --> 00:01:17,930
and I can go to any website I want. So
here I go to Yahoo Finance for the

23
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:22,040
AEX, the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, and
what you see there

24
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:25,038
is that there are little arrows in the
browser

25
00:01:25,038 --> 00:01:29,958
that I can use to select what data I
want to have in my spreadsheet. So you

26
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:30,820
just click

27
00:01:30,821 --> 00:01:33,781
the arrow and then you click OK, and what
you get,

28
00:01:34,017 --> 00:01:38,017
where do you want your data, well just in A1
and there

29
00:01:38,017 --> 00:01:41,074
is the data - right from the web into your
spreadsheet.

30
00:01:41,074 --> 00:01:45,634
Isn't that cool? And this data is not a 
copy-paste,

31
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:50,460
is not a static copy, because if you hit
"Refresh" you'll actually get a new

32
00:01:50,461 --> 00:01:54,075
version of the website in your
spreadsheet. No coding required,

33
00:01:54,075 --> 00:01:57,099
just getting the data in. So this is
nice,

34
00:01:57,099 --> 00:02:01,719
what I can do now is calculate how much
money I can make on the shares that I

35
00:02:02,053 --> 00:02:06,613
have in my portfolio, so let's continue.

36
00:02:07,073 --> 00:02:10,673
I have the value right there, you see, this is
what my

37
00:02:11,004 --> 00:02:14,045
stocks are worth. However, I can't really

38
00:02:14,045 --> 00:02:18,685
calculate with them yet. Let me first get
the number of shares I have in.

39
00:02:19,042 --> 00:02:22,088
So what I'll do now, I'll just copy it
from the other worksheet,

40
00:02:22,088 --> 00:02:26,748
in next videos we'll definitely work on
how to connect worksheets in a better way,

41
00:02:27,032 --> 00:02:30,572
but for now I'm just copying them. And
what I would like to do is - I want to

42
00:02:31,006 --> 00:02:33,012
multiply the number of shares that I
have

43
00:02:33,066 --> 00:02:36,626
with their value. But I can't do it, because

44
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:40,075
the Last Trade value that I get from the
web

45
00:02:40,075 --> 00:02:43,091
is just the text, it's a "String" as we
call it,

46
00:02:43,091 --> 00:02:47,791
and I cannot multiply it, because not
just the value is in there, but also

47
00:02:48,004 --> 00:02:52,053
the the time of the Last Trade.
So I need to manipulate 

48
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:52,935
my data

49
00:02:53,035 --> 00:03:00,795
into being able to be calculated with. So
let me add another column

50
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:06,819
where I will try to obtain the real
value - just the first part

51
00:03:07,024 --> 00:03:10,072
of the String and not the entire thing
that I cannot do anything with.

52
00:03:10,072 --> 00:03:13,074
Well, what Excel has is a function called
LEFT

53
00:03:13,074 --> 00:03:16,714
and that allows you for any text value
to take

54
00:03:17,009 --> 00:03:21,058
a number of characters from the left. So,
what I can do now is - here I want

55
00:03:21,058 --> 00:03:24,087
for this value just the first 4 characters.

56
00:03:24,087 --> 00:03:28,827
and then I get my value. However, I guess
you maybe

57
00:03:29,035 --> 00:03:32,087
predicted this, for the second line this
doesn't work,

58
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:35,727
because there are 5 characters and
not 4.

59
00:03:36,028 --> 00:03:41,056
So, I need a little bit trickery and I
can use the FIND function for that.

60
00:03:41,056 --> 00:03:44,058
What the FIND function does is: in a
given text

61
00:03:44,076 --> 00:03:48,016
it looks for specific value and it gives
you the location

62
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,979
of that String. So you see here the space
is on the 5th

63
00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:55,749
position in our String, and we can use
that in

64
00:03:55,989 --> 00:03:59,970
our LEFT function. So now I'm not going
to take 4 or 5,

65
00:03:59,971 --> 00:04:02,791
what I'm going to take is the location
of the space. 

66
00:04:03,058 --> 00:04:07,077
And then I need to deduct 1 because I
don't want to include the space, I just

67
00:04:07,077 --> 00:04:08,557
want the first part.

68
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:12,820
And if I drag this formula down, you 
see nicely

69
00:04:13,012 --> 00:04:17,040
that I only have the value, and now I
can calculate something!

70
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:18,841
Now I can drag this cell reference

71
00:04:19,001 --> 00:04:22,066
to the right, or I could also
just edit the text,

72
00:04:22,075 --> 00:04:25,735
and now I have the right value for my

73
00:04:26,012 --> 00:04:29,752
stock. So I know what profit I would make
if I would sell

74
00:04:30,002 --> 00:04:34,044
all stocks I have for the current price
taken from the web.

75
00:04:34,044 --> 00:04:38,784
So what you learn in this video is how
to use

76
00:04:39,026 --> 00:04:42,826
String functions to prepare data
and this is something

77
00:04:43,017 --> 00:04:46,035
you're going to encounter a lot in the
following weeks.

78
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:50,038
The data that you get from the web or
data that you download within your

79
00:04:50,038 --> 00:04:50,878
company

80
00:04:51,001 --> 00:04:54,039
often will not have the right form.
You get

81
00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:57,799
a longer list, you get something in a
string while you wanted a text file,

82
00:04:58,036 --> 00:05:01,596
so you have to do some data wrangling
before you can actually start

83
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:03,415
your calculation.
