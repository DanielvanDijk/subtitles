1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:03,579
Maybe we were using the wrong tool all
along,

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,819
so let me show you an other tool to use,
using

3
00:00:06,819 --> 00:00:10,071
a fresh new example. What you see here
is a map

4
00:00:10,071 --> 00:00:14,651
of the Netherlands. This is where we are,  we are
in Delft.

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,769
Suppose I want to take the train

6
00:00:17,779 --> 00:00:21,759
from Delft to Groningen, that's here.

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,789
So there's no direct train and we can
see this on the map,

8
00:00:25,789 --> 00:00:29,000
because the trains are the black lines
on the map

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,057
and there's no direct train from Delft
to Grongingen.

10
00:00:32,057 --> 00:00:35,817
So how am I going to make this travel? I
have two different options,

11
00:00:35,829 --> 00:00:39,189
either I take the train to Leiden and
that's here

12
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:43,000
or I take the train to Rotterdam that's 
there

13
00:00:43,002 --> 00:00:46,960
and from there I can take a direct train

14
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,380
to Groningen, so either I go this way or

15
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:54,720
I go that way. And if I want to calculate
what the best

16
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,040
option is, I also need to add weights to my
arrows.

17
00:00:58,048 --> 00:01:01,648
So this one from Delft to Leiden will take
me

18
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:04,809
21 minutes, from Delft to Rotterdam,

19
00:01:04,909 --> 00:01:08,009
will take me twelve and then from 

20
00:01:08,009 --> 00:01:11,969
Rotterdam to Groningen is two hours and

21
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:15,620
39 minutes and this one

22
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,080
is two hours and 28 minutes. So I can
calculate

23
00:01:19,099 --> 00:01:23,119
my total travel time by summing these
two

24
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,003
and summing those two and for this
representation

25
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:31,009
I don't even need the map anymore. If
I have my graph

26
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:34,043
my lines and my nodes with all the
numbers attached

27
00:01:34,043 --> 00:01:39,223
I can just delete the whole map.
There we go!

28
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:44,980
And this is now a correct representation
of my problem.

29
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:48,960
I have a node Leiden, Rotterdam, Delft

30
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,978
and Groningen and I have arrows
between them,

31
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:56,001
this one, that one and those two and
those arrows.

32
00:01:56,003 --> 00:02:00,912
have weigths. And this is called a graph,
a representation of the problem

33
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:04,029
in terms of nodes and arrows

34
00:02:04,029 --> 00:02:07,980
and of course you have imagined that we
can use this same

35
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:12,380
scenario the same method to analyze our
Bacon problem.

36
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:16,280
Let's have a look at the bacon problem,
how it looks like in a spreadsheet

37
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,319
we have actors and movies and actors

38
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:22,999
that have played in movies and I can
draw this problem

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,002
like a graph too, like I did it with the map
of the Netherlands.

40
00:02:26,009 --> 00:02:29,036
I can say here's Kevin Bacon and he has
played

41
00:02:29,036 --> 00:02:32,816
in the movie 'Crazy Stupid Love'. I just
draw a line

42
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:36,219
between the actor and the movie and I can
repeat this,

43
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:39,600
I can add Emma Stone and Julianne Moore

44
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,000
because they have played in 'Crazy Stupid
Love' too and I can continue this process

45
00:02:44,003 --> 00:02:48,069
and make an entire graph of the problem
that we are analyzing:

46
00:02:48,069 --> 00:02:52,200
Who has played in which movie? And
because we're representing it like a 

47
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:52,960
graph,

48
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,240
you see that immediately your view on
the problem changes,

49
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,540
because it gets really easy now to
calculate the

50
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:04,115
Bacon distance from Bacon to
another actor, because we can just

51
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,020
traverse

52
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:08,340
the lines in the graph and that's what
we're going to explore

53
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,760
in the next video.
