1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:04,200
Now that we have a problem in the form
of a graph,

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,490
we can also start to use different tools.
So we don't need

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:13,099
generic tools anymore. A spreadsheet or
Python are like a Swiss Army knife.

4
00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:17,750
They can do anything you want, you can
use them for budgeting and planning,

5
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:22,970
or for doing a Bacon-like problem. But
now we can use a very specialized tool

6
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:24,810
for graphs, very much

7
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,740
like the tongs you use to eat snails.
They're

8
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:31,539
very very useful if you're eating snails,
but they're pretty useless for

9
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:35,649
anything else like eating pasta, or
eating rice

10
00:00:35,649 --> 00:00:40,850
they're a very specialized tool. And this
is also what the graph tool is about,

11
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:44,420
and the graph tool that we are going to
use, is called Neo4j

12
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:48,079
and this is a graph database,
the word already says it,

13
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,670
is really used to store and analyze graphs.
up

14
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:54,989
So if you download Neo4J, this is a
freely available tool, you can just

15
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:57,340
download it for many different platforms.

16
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:00,890
And if you do that and if you start it,
this is what you will see.

17
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:04,360
Just this little box, what do we do?

18
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,790
So the first thing that we have to do is
select a folder

19
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:12,950
on our filesystem, where we're going to
save the data in, just an empty folder, no

20
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:13,260
magic,

21
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:18,800
you just select a folder, and you hit start
and this is what you get: the green box

22
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,820
with a link. And if you click it, you'll
be taken to your web browser just a

23
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,220
normal browser like Firefox or Chrome

24
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:32,220
will start (your normal browser) and you'll
see this. That's it, this is Neo4j.

25
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:33,820
So it is not immediately clear

26
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:38,000
what you have to do here. First let's
start with getting our bacon data

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,250
into the database, so we go back to our
spreadsheet

28
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:45,040
and we have to save our spreadsheet as
CSV file,

29
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,380
a comma separated value file. This is a
format that Neo4j and many other tools

30
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:54,360
can easily read. Maybe you've done this
before you just click 'Save As' and you

31
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,850
select a location where you want to save your

32
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:01,280
CSV file, enter the file name and then from
the dropdownlist

33
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,990
the 'Save As' one, you select CSV, there

34
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:09,600
we go, comma separated value. We haven't
a dot too many,

35
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,220
we remove the dot and we click 'Save'.

36
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:15,230
And now we save only this worksheet, [we]
can

37
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:18,060
save as a CSV. Excel warns me, he says: I

38
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,030
can only save one worksheet, you lose
pivot tables.

39
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:25,250
We know that, we are okay with it, we want
to save it as a CSV file.

40
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,700
So what we have now if we open the CSV
file,

41
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:31,860
is this. This is how the CSV file
looks like if you open it with notepad

42
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,590
or

43
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:35,730
any other text editor. You have a first-line
that

44
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:38,850
is the first column of the spreadsheet
in this case movie

45
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:42,310
and then you get one line for all of the
lines in the spreadsheet.

46
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:45,990
And columns are separated of course with
a comma,

47
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:50,460
because it's a comma separated value format.
So we have this date.

48
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:54,090
Now we have to get this data into Neo4J.

49
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:58,450
So let's go back to Neo4j, get our CSV
file,

50
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:02,840
there it is and what we can not do is just
select the data and put it in, we cannot

51
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,040
just

52
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,819
copy/paste. We have to use a special
command called LOAD CSV.

53
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:12,980
So we type that into Neo4J, LOAD CSV

54
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,150
from the location where I have just

55
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:19,410
saved the CSV file

56
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:22,810
and then for every line in the CSV file

57
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:26,810
we're going to perform a certain
operation. So here's the location of the

58
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:27,680
CSV file

59
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,060
and we're going to open it as row

60
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,400
and this means that we're going to get
to iterate over the spreadsheet,

61
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,950
over the CSV file and every line is
called

62
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:41,540
row. And this is very much like the for-loop
him Python where we have an

63
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:45,930
iterator i that first has the value one
and two and three

64
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:49,430
this is also what happens to the row. So
what are we going to do

65
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:53,770
for each of the rows? We're going to
create something that is a movie,

66
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:57,069
we will create a movie and the
name of the movie

67
00:03:57,069 --> 00:04:01,880
is row.movie that's the first
column, in this case the only column of our

68
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,540
CSV file. So we can run this

69
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:07,910
by hitting the play button and then
Neo4J says: okay,

70
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:12,260
I have created four nodes. We don't really
know yet

71
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:17,769
what has happened, but something has
happened, because we have created four nodes.

72
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:20,310
So what we can do now, is get the nodes

73
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:24,190
out. And I'm not going to explain the
entire syntax of this language,

74
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:27,520
this language is called Cypher by
the way, I'm just going to show you

75
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,030
a few things that you need to know for
this example, but we'll put links online

76
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:36,020
to backup material, where you can learn
all about Cypher.

77
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:40,790
So how are we going to get the nodes out?
There is a special command called MATCH

78
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:44,730
and that's got means looking for all the
nodes. So in this case we say

79
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:48,680
we match just a node, any type of node

80
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,510
and return that to us. And now we see the
4

81
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,700
nodes that we have entered into the

82
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,400
database,

83
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,260
we see they are movies and they have the
labels that were in the CSV file.

84
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:03,000
We can change the layout a little bit,
we can say that the labels

85
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,060
need to be the name of the movie and
we can play with the size of the noeds.

86
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,600
So know it is easy to see that we need
have the 4 movies

87
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:15,000
in our Neo4j database that were
in our CSV file.

88
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
They're right there, but what you can also
see is that

89
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,160
this is a tool that's made for graphs.

90
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,590
If I just say give me everything that
is in the database

91
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:26,430
the neutral, the normal form is not a list

92
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:29,210
as you would get in a normal database, no
it

93
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:30,440
is our little dots,

94
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,360
the nodes in our database. And it shows us
that we're really working with the graph

95
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,780
database here, something that's

96
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:39,770
optimized for thinking about nodes. Now what
we

97
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:41,680
also need to do in addition to the

98
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,860
movies is get the actors.

99
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:46,350
And we can again use the LOAD CSV
command for that

100
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:50,070
and now we're not creating a movie, we
are creating an actor. And we do that

101
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:54,240
really by saying create an actor we're
not going to add a label

102
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,810
this is a type actor, no we really
say create an actor.

103
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:01,530
And this sounds a little bit cryptic maybe,
but let me show you how that looks like,

104
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:03,960
if I show you all the nodes.

105
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,820
Initially, all of them look great and you
see that

106
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:09,280
indeed some are an actor and some are

107
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:09,479
a movie

108
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:13,699
But what we can do, is again we can play with
the layout. We can say

109
00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:17,000
we want movies to be green and then you see

110
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,979
all the movie nodes are now green and
we can do the same for actors.

111
00:06:21,979 --> 00:06:26,120
Let's say we want actors to be pink,
and now you can see that we really have

112
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,949
two different types of nodes in our
database.

113
00:06:29,949 --> 00:06:30,210
Movies

114
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:34,960
and actors. So of course the next step

115
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,430
that we need to perform, now we have the
movies and the actors in our database

116
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:42,050
is make the connection. So again we have
saved

117
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:47,320
the third worksheet of our spreadsheet
as a CSV file, where we now have two

118
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:47,900
columns.

119
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:52,270
One that's called full name and one that
is called movie.

120
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:55,040
And again we're using the MATCH command
now

121
00:06:55,040 --> 00:07:00,430
First we'll load the CSV file, we
know this by now as a row from the CSV file,

122
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:04,000
but we're going to match each column the
first item

123
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,710
with an actor and second item with a
movie and this is how that looks like.

124
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:12,509
So we say MATCH,

125
00:07:12,509 --> 00:07:17,220
yes we say MATCH,

126
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,580
there it is, we say MATCH, we are going to
match

127
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:23,690
an a is an actor and what are we going
to match it with?

128
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:27,389
Well the name, the full of the
actor has to be equal

129
00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:32,740
to the name that it in the row of our
CSV file.

130
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:36,680
So that's also called full name, so in the
first case the actor that we're going to

131
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,280
make a connection for first is Kevin
Bacon

132
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,840
with the movie Crazy Stupid Love. So this
first match line

133
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:47,930
is going to search for the actor in the
first line and the second match that I'm

134
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:49,139
making now,

135
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:54,740
is saying I'm matching movie and the
name of the movie has to be equal to the

136
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:55,650
movie column

137
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:59,669
in my CSV file, the second column, after
the comma.

138
00:07:59,669 --> 00:08:03,020
So what this first two things do is find
an actor

139
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:06,870
and find a movie. So if I have those too
what I need to do

140
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:10,460
is make a connection between them and I do
that with a CREATE.

141
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:13,550
Just as I said create an actor and
create a movie,

142
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:17,919
and now creating a link from a the actor

143
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,820
to m the movie and I'm giving that connection

144
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,770
a name. I'm naming it 'acted', so a

145
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:27,380
acted in m, Kevin Bacon acted in

146
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:30,960
Crazy Stupid Love. And if I execute this
CREATE

147
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:36,029
then again Neo4J says okay I have created
a bunch of relations.

148
00:08:36,029 --> 00:08:39,729
So let's have a look at how it actually
is visualised

149
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:41,469
If I just use the same

150
00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:43,879
show me all nodes, then I get a graph

151
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:47,389
instantaneously. So if I just put my data
in and I

152
00:08:47,389 --> 00:08:48,850
say to Neo4j

153
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:53,689
give me the data, this is what I get. It's
immediately visualized as a graph

154
00:08:53,689 --> 00:08:57,920
and you can see of course we noticed by
now Kevin Bacon has played in Crazy

155
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,399
Stupid Love with

156
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:03,119
Julianne Moore. It's all right there and
very much looks like

157
00:09:03,119 --> 00:09:06,550
the picture that we had in the previous
video that we were drawing on the

158
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:07,410
spreadsheet,

159
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:13,089
we get a graph immediately. So we're almost
there, we have the right representation

160
00:09:13,089 --> 00:09:13,670
now,

161
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:16,790
but now of course we still want to
perform the calculation

162
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:22,550
of the bacon number. So let me show you
how that goes, if you use Neo4j.

163
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:25,139
So we want to do, is calculate

164
00:09:25,139 --> 00:09:29,189
a path through the graph, a number of
steps like we did

165
00:09:29,189 --> 00:09:31,600
Delft, Rotterdam, Grongingen, now we want
to

166
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,209
have Kevin Bacon

167
00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:37,769
to Julianne Moore, so we're matching again,
we're looking into database, but now

168
00:09:37,769 --> 00:09:40,100
we're not looking for one node, we're
looking for

169
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:43,679
a path through the nodes from an actor

170
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:47,369
with the name Kevin Bacon to another
actor

171
00:09:47,369 --> 00:09:50,639
with no specific name. We don't know the
name and

172
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:55,519
how does the path have to look like?
Well it has to be two hops,

173
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,819
an actor, a movie, another actor and what
do

174
00:09:58,819 --> 00:09:59,899
we want to return?

175
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:03,929
If we have found such a path from Kevin
Bacon to another actor,

176
00:10:03,929 --> 00:10:08,139
we would like to have the name of the
other actor and if we execute this

177
00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:12,189
indeed we get all the actors that have a
bacon number of two,

178
00:10:12,189 --> 00:10:16,420
that are one-hop away or in this
visualization two hops away

179
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:19,429
from Kevin Bacon. We can do the same
thing

180
00:10:19,429 --> 00:10:24,170
for everyone who has bacon number three
because then we need four hops.

181
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:27,420
It works. It's that easy to do it with
Neo4j.

182
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:31,369
The only problem that we have here, is that
Scarlett Johansson

183
00:10:31,369 --> 00:10:36,019
occurs twice, because there are two ways
that we can reach her from Kevin Bacon.

184
00:10:36,019 --> 00:10:37,279
And we can solve this

185
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:41,449
with a very similar construct that we
have used all the way back in the pivot

186
00:10:41,449 --> 00:10:42,410
tabel video,

187
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:46,249
the DISTINCT. And if we add that, we get
only two

188
00:10:46,249 --> 00:10:49,749
actors with a bacon number of three. So
you see it's just

189
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:53,759
one-line and then we get everyone with
bacon number two,

190
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:54,399
everyone with bacon

191
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,899
number three, which is already pretty
amazing, but we can do better than that.

192
00:10:58,899 --> 00:10:59,879
We can calculate

193
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:04,239
all bacon number of everyone with just
one line

194
00:11:04,239 --> 00:11:08,499
of Cypher code. So what we are
going to do, is we're going to say

195
00:11:08,499 --> 00:11:11,350
give me the shortest path and the shortest
path

196
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:15,800
is not a function that I have defined,
this is just a built-in function in

197
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,730
Cypher. So we're going to say,

198
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:22,660
give me the shortest path from the node that
matches Kevin Bacon, we've seen that in a

199
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,629
previous queries as well,

200
00:11:24,629 --> 00:11:30,360
and what I want is only the star, so
not two steps or four steps or

201
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,759
100 steps, any number of steps. We don't
care that's what the little star

202
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:36,069
indicates

203
00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:40,079
and what we want to have him return is
again the name of the actor,

204
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,959
but we also want, because we have named
this path

205
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:47,550
p, the length of the path. TADA!

206
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:52,319
And now indeed we get Kevin Bacon has 0,
because the path

207
00:11:52,319 --> 00:11:57,670
from him to him is zero and people with
bacon number two

208
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:00,059
have two hops and bacon number three

209
00:12:00,059 --> 00:12:03,059
have four hops. So we're almost there, we
only want

210
00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:04,899
Kevin Bacon to have one and all the

211
00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:06,179
others to have

212
00:12:06,179 --> 00:12:10,639
two steps as one step. So if we divide it
by two and add one,

213
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,059
we have all bacon number for everyone

214
00:12:14,059 --> 00:12:16,999
doesn't matter how long the path is, in

215
00:12:16,999 --> 00:12:21,279
only one line of Cypher. Isn't that cool?
Remember that last week, we needed

216
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:25,879
like 25 array formuls, for all of
that actors and we still needed

217
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:32,629
20, to 25 lines of Python and here
we can do it in just one line of Cypher.

218
00:12:32,629 --> 00:12:35,239
So don't get me wrong, this is not a
Neo4j

219
00:12:35,239 --> 00:12:39,230
advertisement, I'm not saying that Neo4j
is better than Python or is

220
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,239
better than Excel,

221
00:12:41,239 --> 00:12:43,779
For some problems that are really
graphy,

222
00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:47,220
Neo4j is a very good solution,
but

223
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:50,449
like the thongs for a snail, it's very specific.

224
00:12:50,449 --> 00:12:55,850
You can't use it for planning or
budgeting. It's for one specific tool only.

225
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:59,410
So what I hope you take away from this
week and previous week's videos,

226
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:02,819
is that sometimes you shouldn't run

227
00:13:02,819 --> 00:13:05,319
to your spreadsheet immediately. Of course
in

228
00:13:05,319 --> 00:13:06,600
the first six weeks

229
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,360
I showed you

230
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,089
everything there is to know about
spreadsheets, you can do many many things

231
00:13:11,089 --> 00:13:11,980
with them,

232
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:15,540
but sometimes is also very good strategy
just to

233
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,679
step away from the spreadsheet. Don't go
to your computer,

234
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:23,259
first think about a problem, go to the
white board and sometimes you can a tool

235
00:13:23,259 --> 00:13:23,549
that is

236
00:13:23,549 --> 00:13:27,470
very suited for small part of your
problem better.

237
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:30,519
So if you ever need to calculate
a bacon number

238
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:35,089
now you know that Neo4J, or another graph
database might be a better solution

239
00:13:35,089 --> 00:13:36,070
than a spreadsheet.
