Last week we worked on calculating Bacon
numbers

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:08,073
and we did that both in Excel and in Python.
And what I hope you took away from last

3
00:00:08,073 --> 00:00:11,074
week's videos and also from last week's
exercises,

4
00:00:11,074 --> 00:00:14,083
is that the tool you use influences

5
00:00:14,083 --> 00:00:18,883
what solution you can come up with. If
you're working in Excel then typically

6
00:00:19,009 --> 00:00:19,858
you think

7
00:00:19,939 --> 00:00:23,006
in terms of cells and references between
cells.

8
00:00:23,006 --> 00:00:26,033
And if you have to work with lists in
Excel you have to

9
00:00:26,033 --> 00:00:29,051
use array formulas and it's possible,

10
00:00:29,051 --> 00:00:32,691
but it's harder and this limits the way
you can think.

11
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,041
Whereas if you solved the same problem in
Python

12
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:39,059
it gets a lot easier, because lists are

13
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:43,739
first class citizens. You can just take
any range in the spreadsheet

14
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:47,919
and put it into a list immediately and
if you want to do some sort of operation

15
00:00:48,045 --> 00:00:51,825
on your list, like a minimum you just
have to use

16
00:00:52,016 --> 00:00:56,505
minus and the list that you want to work
on. You don't have to fiddle with array

17
00:00:56,505 --> 00:00:57,340
formulas

18
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:00,539
so because you're using Python it's

19
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:04,159
easier to work with lists, because they
are built-in in Python

20
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,031
and you don't have to go through a lot
of trouble and 

21
00:01:07,031 --> 00:01:10,871
exactly this idea holds in many cases, so
if you use

22
00:01:11,022 --> 00:01:14,065
the wrong tool for the job then

23
00:01:14,065 --> 00:01:18,845
it is not only less efficient to hammer
a screw in,

24
00:01:19,011 --> 00:01:23,013
it is not just that. It gets harder and
also limits your

25
00:01:23,031 --> 00:01:26,840
imagination. If you always build stuff
with a hammer,

26
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,063
then probably you're never going to come
up with the dovetail connection,

27
00:01:31,063 --> 00:01:34,903
because this is a connection where you 
connect wood without using any nails.

28
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:38,953
So you don't need the hammer and if
you're always grabbing for the hammer

29
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:39,720
first

30
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,160
you will never come up with this solution.
And this exact same idea holds in data

31
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,020
problems,

32
00:01:45,028 --> 00:01:48,063
if you always sit down at your
spreadsheet immediately

33
00:01:48,063 --> 00:01:52,077
there are some sort of solutions that
you're just never going to come up with,

34
00:01:52,077 --> 00:01:56,017
because they don't fit in the
spreadsheet paradigm and that's what

35
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,040
this week's videos

36
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,240
are all about!
