Hi, in a previous video

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:06,920
I told you about two scenarios in which
a VLOOKUP function is not the

3
00:00:07,043 --> 00:00:08,022
perfect solution.

4
00:00:08,022 --> 00:00:12,024
First, if you need speed, and second, if
you want to have lookups

5
00:00:12,024 --> 00:00:16,544
that go back stream, the strange direction
for a VLOOKUP.

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,904
So, in this video I'm going to show you

7
00:00:20,015 --> 00:00:24,046
how to resolve that situation, where I am going
to teach you two new methods

8
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:28,380
to solve it. But first let's take a step
back, let's take our time machine

9
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:32,480
and go back to the second video in which
I talked about what the exact

10
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,920
ingredients are

11
00:00:34,019 --> 00:00:37,419
for a lookup function. It was: what am I
going to look for,

12
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:41,960
where am I looking it up, and what am I
going to return.

13
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,660
Those three ingredients occur

14
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,080
in VLOOKUP function. For our new
implementation using two new functions

15
00:00:50,084 --> 00:00:53,924
we're going to split those two parts, so
we use one function

16
00:00:54,069 --> 00:00:58,569
for finding a value and one function for
returning a value.

17
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:02,239
And for finding a value we're going to
use the

18
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,006
MATCH function, and here, in this video
I'll show you how it works.

19
00:01:06,006 --> 00:01:09,010
So we type in 'MATCH', we use the MATCH
function,

20
00:01:09,046 --> 00:01:13,065
we input what are we going to look for,
and the second parameter

21
00:01:13,065 --> 00:01:18,540
is where am I going to find it. The third
parameter is very similar to the fourth

22
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,940
parameter of the VLOOKUP, where I can
say

23
00:01:21,013 --> 00:01:24,213
I want to have a value that's higher,
exact value,

24
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:27,920
or lower. And we pick the exact value here,
much like

25
00:01:28,029 --> 00:01:31,009
the FALSE option in VLOOKUP. So
you see

26
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:38,589
Claw Hammer, A0, is on the second line. It's not that
impressive so let me sort

27
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,056
the ProductInfo worksheet so then you can
see exactly how the MATCH works. So we've

28
00:01:42,056 --> 00:01:43,436
sorted it now,

29
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:47,003
A0 is now in the sixth line and our
MATCH function

30
00:01:47,003 --> 00:01:50,035
indeed returns A0 code is on

31
00:01:50,035 --> 00:01:53,755
row 6. That's what the MATCH

32
00:01:54,027 --> 00:01:57,767
function does - for a given range it tells
you on what

33
00:01:58,007 --> 00:02:01,093
row a given value is. So we have the first
part of our

34
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:06,000
new scenario covered. What about the
second part? For the second part we're

35
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,000
going to use the

36
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,065
INDEX function.

37
00:02:08,074 --> 00:02:11,934
INDEX function is going to return us in
a given range

38
00:02:12,054 --> 00:02:17,056
this specific row and column. So here you
can see how it looks.

39
00:02:17,056 --> 00:02:20,736
Again, we know that A0 is on the
sixth row,

40
00:02:21,014 --> 00:02:24,028
but we want to have the name instead of
the code.

41
00:02:24,028 --> 00:02:30,032
So, we go back to our original formula,
we remove the MATCH, we just put it with

42
00:02:30,032 --> 00:02:33,043
"Ctrl X" on the clipboard. We put in the
INDEX.

43
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,015
What are we going to return? We are going to
return the B column.

44
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,012
That's the first parameter, what are we going
to return, what

45
00:02:41,012 --> 00:02:44,038
row. Well we know the row. The row where we
have just

46
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:48,079
found our value. And what column?
Well, B is only one column

47
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:52,759
so we're just inputting 1 there. So now
you see we have the name

48
00:02:53,013 --> 00:02:56,072
associated with the value, the line
number,

49
00:02:56,072 --> 00:02:59,099
on which we have just matched. And, as you
can see,

50
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:03,419
you see me double-click and run this
INDEX-MATCH

51
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,960
function for the entire, all thousands of
lines.

52
00:03:07,065 --> 00:03:11,665
You see the first benefit - speed! It's
really a lot quicker.

53
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,560
But using INDEX-MATCH

54
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:18,000
over the VLOOKUP has another benefit.
You remember this scenario

55
00:03:18,055 --> 00:03:21,077
where our boss comes in and says "Hey, I
want to have

56
00:03:21,077 --> 00:03:25,197
these codes associated with these
products, because I want to enter

57
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:25,820
them

58
00:03:26,011 --> 00:03:29,531
in the register, because I want to enter
a discount".

59
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:33,722
We can solve this problem now. We tried
with a VLOOKUP with the -1.

60
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:38,002
Let's get rid of that and let's use
an INDEX-MATCH here as well.

61
00:03:38,002 --> 00:03:41,622
I like to start with the MATCH part
because it's easier to debug,

62
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,980
it's easier to see what is being matched if
it doesn't work.

63
00:03:45,004 --> 00:03:49,011
So let's match. We're going to look for
the Name in the B column

64
00:03:49,047 --> 00:03:52,547
and return the exact match - there it is!

65
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:57,220
We know this by now, the Claw Hammer is
on the sixth line. So we remove the MATCH,

66
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:00,540
we just cut it for a while, now we input
the INDEX.

67
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,920
What are we going to return? Codes!

68
00:04:04,047 --> 00:04:08,007
What row do we want to return? Well, we know
this, we could have entered 6, because

69
00:04:08,007 --> 00:04:09,280
we know the line,

70
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,620
but we enter the MATCH function there, and
it's only one column,

71
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,540
so we use 1. So you see the second
benefit

72
00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:20,014
of using INDEX-MATCH over 
VLOOKUP is

73
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:21,440
going back-stream.

74
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,860
It doesn't matter what we want to return, 
in this case you want to return our 

75
00:04:25,023 --> 00:04:28,823
next-door neighbour, but we can do anything!
The INDEX-MATCH is very flexible,

76
00:04:29,005 --> 00:04:32,013
we could also return, if we have match
here, return

77
00:04:32,085 --> 00:04:36,325
the cell below it, or the sell three
to the right and one

78
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,580
on top, it doesn't matter! The INDEX-MATCH

79
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,880
lets you return anything you want. So for
some scenarios

80
00:04:43,012 --> 00:04:47,352
INDEX-MATCH is better than VLOOKUP.
See you next week!
