00:00:01,005 --> 00:00:03,785
Welcome back! In the previous video we've
looked at

2
00:00:04,029 --> 00:00:08,005
reasons why you want to use lookup
functions and that was because

3
00:00:08,005 --> 00:00:11,534
direct links in spreadsheets are going 
to be messed up

4
00:00:11,579 --> 00:00:15,299
if you change your data on the other
side, for example, by sorting.

5
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:19,088
I really hope you have this ingrained
into your spreadsheet brain -

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,920
that if you see a formula like this, if 
you see a direct link

7
00:00:23,074 --> 00:00:26,374
in your own worksheets or in a spreadsheet
that your colleague has made,

8
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:26,940
for example,

9
00:00:27,073 --> 00:00:31,082
try to think: is this really the best way 
to organize my spreadsheet?

10
00:00:31,082 --> 00:00:36,084
Am I really sure that that C2 is going
to contain the same value

11
00:00:36,084 --> 00:00:40,095
if I look at the spreadsheet tomorrow? 
So what can we do about this?

12
00:00:40,095 --> 00:00:44,135
We can use lookup functions and those
will be explained

13
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:47,096
in this week's videos.

14
00:00:47,096 --> 00:00:51,576
But first, let's take a step back and not talk 
about spreadsheets for like 1 minute.

15
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,820
What actually does it mean

16
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:58,009
if you're looking up a value? 
Let's look at that

17
00:00:58,009 --> 00:01:02,012
outside of the spreadsheet context in,
well, the canonical example

18
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:07,319
of looking something up - a phone book. What 
are the three ingredients that you use if

19
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,035
you look something up in a phone book?

20
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:12,079
Well, first of all, you have a value that
you're looking for,

21
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:17,599
in this case the name Bauer. That's what 
we're looking up. The second ingredient is

22
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:19,002
what are we looking in,

23
00:01:19,002 --> 00:01:22,027
in this case the phone book of 
NamesandNumbers.com.

24
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:27,960
And third ingredient isn't actually 
that obvious - the third ingredient of searching

25
00:01:28,008 --> 00:01:32,047
is what am I going to return. In this
example we are returning

26
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:38,051
the town in which Bauer lives. And 
this three ingredients are also occurring

27
00:01:38,051 --> 00:01:42,751
in lookup functions in a spreadsheet. 
So let's look at how that looks:

28
00:01:43,018 --> 00:01:46,698
we use a formula here. First of all, 
we're going to get rid

29
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:50,029
of those direct links. We will 
select them and just say:

30
00:01:50,029 --> 00:01:54,038
right click, Clear Contents. We don't
want to see those direct links again.

31
00:01:54,038 --> 00:01:57,052
Now we have a room to import our new 
formula,

32
00:01:57,052 --> 00:02:00,095
the VLOOKUP. So we just type VLOOKUP

33
00:02:00,095 --> 00:02:05,495
in our formula and now we input 
the three ingredients for looking up:

34
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:09,013
first of all - what are we looking for. 
That's the code.

35
00:02:09,013 --> 00:02:13,842
Second, what are we looking in - 
the ProductInfo worksheet.

36
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:16,319
And third of all, what are we going 
to return:

37
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:20,011
the third column of the ProductInfo 
worksheet.

38
00:02:20,011 --> 00:02:23,056
And now you see - we have 
associated price

39
00:02:23,056 --> 00:02:27,876
with the Bench, in this case 
the B809 product code.

40
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,580
So quick question: 

41
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:34,610
is this formula perfect? Apart from
whether or not you know 

42
00:02:34,629 --> 00:02:35,429
the VLOOKUP function,

43
00:02:35,429 --> 00:02:38,047
can you spot what actually is wrong with

44
00:02:38,047 --> 00:02:41,887
this formula? I'll give you five seconds 
to think about it.

45
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,880
It's not perfect, right? You know that
because I forgot the dollar sign ($).

46
00:02:49,045 --> 00:02:53,885
If I draw this formula down now, you'll
see that the links get messed up

47
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:57,469
because I didn't input the dollar sign.
So let's fix that first.

48
00:02:57,629 --> 00:03:01,018
Just delete the original reference and
add the dollar signs.

49
00:03:01,018 --> 00:03:04,607
By the way, you don't have to do it
manually as I do here.

50
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:07,081
Which you can also do is select the
reference and hit

51
00:03:07,081 --> 00:03:11,201
F4, and then the dollars will be
input for you. So we drag this

52
00:03:11,201 --> 00:03:12,073
formula down

53
00:03:12,073 --> 00:03:15,633
and now you can see it is perfect - 
we're looking up

54
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:20,229
the right values. So maybe you missed what I
did here because it went a little bit

55
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:20,900
quickly.

56
00:03:21,012 --> 00:03:24,015
Let's take a step back and do all
the things

57
00:03:24,015 --> 00:03:28,047
step for step. All the lookup ingredients
point exactly at what they are.

58
00:03:28,047 --> 00:03:32,207
So remember the three ingredients - what are
we looking for,

59
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:36,059
what are we looking in, and what are we
going to return. You see that they occur

60
00:03:36,059 --> 00:03:41,039
in the VLOOKUP function as well. The
first part is what am I looking for,

61
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,060
this is the code. The second part is what
am I looking in,

62
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:48,619
it's this part of the ProductInfo
worksheet.

63
00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:52,043
And the final argument, I would say, is
the most tricky,

64
00:03:52,043 --> 00:03:55,783
because it's just a number, it doesn't
really look spreadsheety

65
00:03:55,909 --> 00:03:58,912
with a reference, and it actually means
what

66
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:03,213
number of column am I going to return. 
So in this case it's 3,

67
00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:07,072
which means I'm returning the third
column of the whole range

68
00:04:07,072 --> 00:04:11,592
that I have selected. And then you see,
with this we obtain the selling

69
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,580
price

70
00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:16,007
for each of the codes. We can do the
exact same thing

71
00:04:16,007 --> 00:04:20,486
if we also want to look up the names
associated with a certain code.

72
00:04:20,549 --> 00:04:24,013
The only thing we have to change is, in
case of the names we're looking

73
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:26,014
for, the second column to return.

74
00:04:26,014 --> 00:04:29,008
The rest of the formula is the same - 
we're looking for the same value

75
00:04:29,008 --> 00:04:32,708
in the same range. We are only returning 
a different value.

76
00:04:33,029 --> 00:04:37,035
With that we have made a perfect
connection between two worksheets

77
00:04:37,035 --> 00:04:40,066
based on the codes that occur 
in both of them.

78
00:04:40,066 --> 00:04:45,026
In the next video we're going to look at
the mysterious fourth parameter of the

79
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,360
VLOOKUP function

80
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,200
that I have not yet used in this video.
See you there!
