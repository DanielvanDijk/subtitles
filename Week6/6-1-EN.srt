1
00:00:02,024 --> 00:00:05,027
So we've talked about spreadsheets a lot
the past couple of weeks,

2
00:00:05,054 --> 00:00:09,374
so it isn't it time we talk about the
elephant in the room:

3
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:13,025
Problems with spreadsheets, because you
must have encountered them

4
00:00:13,025 --> 00:00:16,068
in the exercises or maybe in your
daily job with spreadsheets

5
00:00:16,068 --> 00:00:21,868
you run into problems with spreadsheets.
And it's not surprising if you remember

6
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:25,022
the numbers from the first week that
95%

7
00:00:25,022 --> 00:00:29,602
of all companies still use spreadsheets
and that 50% of

8
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:34,020
spreadsheets are used in decision
making and then of course is not so

9
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,021
surprising

10
00:00:35,028 --> 00:00:38,948
that problems arise. And you remember maybe
also

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,055
that spreadsheets have a very long
life-span: 5 years on average!

12
00:00:43,055 --> 00:00:46,975
During which they are used by 12
different people.

13
00:00:46,989 --> 00:00:50,769
And most spreadsheets do not have proper
documentation.

14
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,037
So there's actually no way if you
think about it that

15
00:00:54,037 --> 00:00:58,917
this would go right. If it's so
important for companies

16
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,629
and many people are involved, things are
bound to get

17
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:05,009
wrong. And they just do.

18
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:09,033
There even is a European Spreadsheet Risk

19
00:01:09,033 --> 00:01:14,433
Interest Group  (EUSPRIG.org) that
keeps a list of spreadsheet horror

20
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,520
stories.

21
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,960
It's quite funny, if you have some time
after the exercise of this week's I

22
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,004
recommend you go there and have a look
at

23
00:01:22,011 --> 00:01:25,431
a lot of companies and organizations
that

24
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,979
run into some kind of trouble from
very small to very large problems

25
00:01:29,979 --> 00:01:34,004
because of spreadsheets. And I've compiled
the most fun

26
00:01:34,004 --> 00:01:38,153
3 spreadsheet horror stories. Here's one that I
really like

27
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:41,193
the London Olympics in 2012.

28
00:01:41,229 --> 00:01:45,899
So you would expect the London Olympics
like the biggest event of the year with

29
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:47,907
a gazillion pounds in budget

30
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:52,519
to have a very sophisticated ticketing
system.

31
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,600
They don't, they use spreadsheets to keep
track of

32
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,159
the tickets they've sold. And they made a tiny
mistake in one of their spreadsheets

33
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,560
and this ended up in one of the stadiums
being

34
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:08,034
overbooked by 10,000 tickets. So it's not really
money lost but it was of course very

35
00:02:08,034 --> 00:02:10,854
embarrassing. People had to come into the
ticket

36
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:13,002
office to exchange their tickets for 
another day

37
00:02:13,002 --> 00:02:17,020
So it is a really nice example of a spreadsheet
horror story.

38
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:21,480
Here's another one. A university in the
US lost 2.4 million

39
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,860
dollars, because of a spreadhseet problem and
here's another one: a Canadian power company

40
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:32,100
lost 24 million dollars, because of a
copy paste error in a spreadsheet.

41
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,840
So of course it is very easy to blame
spreadsheets, you could say

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,120
spreadsheets are just bad and this is
why we have mistakes. But that's really

43
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,300
not fair, this is not a typical spreadsheet
problem.

44
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,979
If you look at other domains, for instance
programming.

45
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:51,002
Programming has very similar error rates

46
00:02:51,006 --> 00:02:54,014
to spreadsheet development. About 1 to 5
percent

47
00:02:54,086 --> 00:02:59,000
of all lines of code or all formulas
have an error

48
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,009
and the same goes for other cognitive
design

49
00:03:02,009 --> 00:03:05,011
activities like creative writing.

50
00:03:05,029 --> 00:03:08,809
Also if you're writing you tend to make
tiny mistakes.

51
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,058
Just human brains aren't better then a
1 to 5 percent

52
00:03:12,068 --> 00:03:17,008
error ratio and this is understandable.
And if you look at

53
00:03:17,009 --> 00:03:21,017
problems in programming, very very
similar type of

54
00:03:21,017 --> 00:03:24,817
horror stories exist, very recent horror
stories

55
00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:28,619
in the programming domain. You have
healthcare.gov, there were

56
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,960
recently a few

57
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,006
very big bugs like heartbleed and the go to
fail

58
00:03:33,015 --> 00:03:37,041
So you can't really blame spreadsheet
for being problematic, because

59
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:42,101
other types of programming really run
into very very similar problems.

60
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,700
So why is that? Like

61
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:49,980
everything, spreadsheets and software
products start small

62
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,004
they start with small little cute
puppies, you can

63
00:03:53,012 --> 00:03:56,992
easily manage them, because they're still
young and simple.

64
00:03:57,001 --> 00:04:00,067
Same goes with spreadsheets, you start of with
one worksheet,

65
00:04:00,067 --> 00:04:04,079
a bunch of formulas, looks very cute,
nothing is problematic.

66
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:07,859
However they all grow up to be this guy,

67
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,000
right? If you don't train your dog and
if you don't

68
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:15,510
manage your spreadsheet or manage your software
everything will go wrong.

69
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,069
So that's exactly what this week's videos

70
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:23,539
are about. We will talk about how to
manage your spreadsheet and make sure

71
00:04:23,539 --> 00:04:26,055
that it grows up into a responsible dog

72
00:04:26,055 --> 00:04:28,855
and not a couch-shredding Monster
