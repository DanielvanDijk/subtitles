1
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:05,002
In the previous video, we've turned our
data into a data table

2
00:00:05,002 --> 00:00:09,002
and done some analysis on top of that. So
what we want to do now is

3
00:00:09,002 --> 00:00:13,011
actually make our planning. We want to
make a schedule for what teacher teaches

4
00:00:13,029 --> 00:00:14,389
what course on what day of the week.

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,960
So ultimately we're going to want
something like this,

6
00:00:18,027 --> 00:00:21,052
but let's start with an intermediary
step first.

7
00:00:21,052 --> 00:00:24,832
We have here a list of what courses are
taught on

8
00:00:25,001 --> 00:00:28,360
what day of the week. So we want to have
in our planning

9
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:32,660
initially, we don't have the names yet, we
just want to have X's

10
00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:37,009
on the spots where we have a course and
empty spots or dashes

11
00:00:37,009 --> 00:00:40,399
on the place where we do not have a
course for a given level.

12
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,023
So we can do that with a function that
we have already seen in the past,

13
00:00:44,023 --> 00:00:48,403
namely the FIND function. There we go,

14
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:53,320
we can use the FIND function to search
for

15
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,420
a value in a string as we've seen before.
So we're going to find

16
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:01,591
this 1 in the list of all the courses
that we have on Monday.

17
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:05,379
And we have found it, if we execute this
formula,

18
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:08,051
you see that indeed there is a 1 in this
string

19
00:01:08,051 --> 00:01:13,831
on the first spot, so on 1. And here we
have to add a dollar of course, because if

20
00:01:14,011 --> 00:01:16,380
we're going drag the function down

21
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:20,599
then we want to stay focused, stay
pointing on the first line.

22
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,700
And what you see now is that in case we
do not find the one, we get

23
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:28,040
an error value. We can catch that error value
with a function

24
00:01:28,075 --> 00:01:31,975
called ISERROR, so we can ask Excel is

25
00:01:32,014 --> 00:01:35,006
this formula resulting in an error,
yes or no?

26
00:01:35,006 --> 00:01:39,306
Or I should say true or false, because
that will be the result of the formula,

27
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:43,000
you see in the case where we have found
one we get a FALSE.

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,909
Now we can slap and IF on top of that, we
can say

29
00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:52,480
if we get an error well then we want to have
a dash and if we do not get an error then

30
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,719
we want to have an X.

31
00:01:53,869 --> 00:01:59,002
So that we get X's in all the spots
where we indeed have the given course

32
00:01:59,002 --> 00:02:00,682
on the given day.

33
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,799
So almost there, we can drag this
formula to the right

34
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:07,033
and then we have

35
00:02:07,033 --> 00:02:11,078
our formula. Unfortunately, we have
forgotten something

36
00:02:11,078 --> 00:02:15,338
again another dollar. They are so
annoying and so easy to forget,

37
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,620
right?

38
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:21,840
So if we add a dollar to our formula, it
will work we can drag into the right

39
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,871
and indeed we have got our function.

40
00:02:26,004 --> 00:02:30,051
But I do not particularly like this formula a
lot... If you look at it

41
00:02:30,051 --> 00:02:33,072
you have the one dollar here and
the other dollar there,

42
00:02:33,072 --> 00:02:37,972
I'm pretty sure that if you look at this
formula tomorrow or maybe in a week or

43
00:02:38,042 --> 00:02:43,482
three, you look at this like: "I don't really
remember what is going on here".

44
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:47,000
So we can make this formula a lot easier,

45
00:02:47,005 --> 00:02:50,054
by using... I guess you can guess this...

46
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:54,019
A named range. So if we take this

47
00:02:54,019 --> 00:02:57,028
first row of the spreadsheet and

48
00:02:57,028 --> 00:03:00,034
change that into a named range let's call
this

49
00:03:00,034 --> 00:03:05,049
HorzLevels, Horizontal Levels. Then there's a
special trick that we can use,

50
00:03:05,049 --> 00:03:10,086
if we use a named range like this. What we
can do is what we can refer to that named range

51
00:03:10,086 --> 00:03:11,037

52
00:03:11,037 --> 00:03:14,095
from a lower row. Let's have a look at how
that looks like.

53
00:03:14,095 --> 00:03:17,575
If we just enter into this cell: is

54
00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:21,055
equal to the named range, what we
actually get

55
00:03:21,055 --> 00:03:25,054
is the intersection of the column that
this cell is in

56
00:03:25,054 --> 00:03:28,083
and the row that represents the named range.

57
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:32,903
So without doing anything, no cell
references or no calculation, we're just

58
00:03:33,001 --> 00:03:36,087
pointing at a named range, we get the value

59
00:03:36,087 --> 00:03:40,667
at the intersection. We can copy this 
down no ugly dollars needed,

60
00:03:41,001 --> 00:03:44,026
and you'll see that you get the value
from the named range. And if you go

61
00:03:44,026 --> 00:03:45,045
outside of it

62
00:03:45,045 --> 00:03:49,079
then you get an error. We can use this
little trick

63
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:54,619
to beautify the formula that we just had,
let's have a look at how it looks like.

64
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,000
So here again, in slow-motion

65
00:03:58,006 --> 00:04:02,500
I will show you what we've done, because
this might take you a while, for your

66
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,440
brain

67
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,209
to really understand how the intersection
works. So if you refer

68
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:11,003
from a cell to a given named range what
you will get

69
00:04:11,003 --> 00:04:14,843
as a result is the intersection of the
column you are in

70
00:04:15,011 --> 00:04:19,130
and the named range. So we can use
that in

71
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:23,600
this function, lets see how that goes. So
we can get rid of that 

72
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,980
ugly little dollar, let's remove it right
away. And we can

73
00:04:27,014 --> 00:04:30,088
replace it by a reference to the named range.

74
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:35,000
It's a lot easier to read, you don't need to
think about the dollars, you don't need to think

75
00:04:35,006 --> 00:04:36,006
about copying,

76
00:04:36,006 --> 00:04:39,042
you could just say I'm pointing up to

77
00:04:39,042 --> 00:04:43,022
the Horizontal Levels named range. And
this trick does not 

78
00:04:43,026 --> 00:04:46,034
only work within one worksheet, it also
works

79
00:04:46,034 --> 00:04:49,035
between worksheets. So if we go back to
this

80
00:04:49,044 --> 00:04:52,095
lessons worksheet and call this column
'levels',

81
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:56,915
we can also use it from this worksheet.
So if we refer now

82
00:04:57,069 --> 00:05:01,889
back to the worksheet, no formula is needed,
no functions needed, just

83
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:06,089
a reference. You see that in the same
fashion you get the intersection

84
00:05:06,089 --> 00:05:11,009
of the named range in the one worksheet
and the row you are in currently.

85
00:05:11,072 --> 00:05:14,952
So we can use that as well here, we are
going to say I want to find

86
00:05:15,051 --> 00:05:19,031
the horizontal level in the levels. So your
formula

87
00:05:19,047 --> 00:05:22,054
is a lot more readable, you can just
navigate

88
00:05:22,054 --> 00:05:25,814
the named ranges that are in the
worksheet. If you have forgotten where

89
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,840
they are,

90
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,889
by using the drag down and selecting a
named range within the formula.

91
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,904
So from ugly dollars to readable

92
00:05:34,018 --> 00:05:37,058
functions with named ranges.
