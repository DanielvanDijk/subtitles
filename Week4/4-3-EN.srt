00:00:01,069 --> 00:00:03,037
In the previous video I showed you how to
use

2
00:00:03,037 --> 00:00:06,917
named ranges. They're really nice to use,
because it makes it a lot easier,

3
00:00:07,024 --> 00:00:11,037
to read your formulas. However, there is still an open challenge,

4
00:00:11,037 --> 00:00:14,837
because we want to be able to add new
teachers to our worksheet, 

5
00:00:15,019 --> 00:00:19,959
without having to update either the formulas
or the named range. So if we would like to

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:19,965

7
00:00:19,965 --> 00:00:23,085
add for instance myself, I'm going to
moonlight as a dance teacher,

8
00:00:23,085 --> 00:00:26,585
I want those formulas to be updated automatically

9
00:00:26,869 --> 00:00:30,038
and our current solution of using an
entire column as a named range

10
00:00:30,038 --> 00:00:33,089
is actually no good, because it blocks
all of the cells

11
00:00:33,089 --> 00:00:37,068
underneath the data. So in this video I'm
going to show you an alternative

12
00:00:37,068 --> 00:00:38,240
solution

13
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:43,000
that will address both of these problems.
We can select

14
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:47,230
our data. Let me remove myself, I will
re-add myself later. 

15
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,899
Now we can select all the data 
in our worksheet and we can insert

16
00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:53,924
a data table; insert table right
there.

17
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:59,005
And then Excel asks us to select what data
we would like in the data table

18
00:00:59,005 --> 00:01:03,925
and also whether or not our data has
headers, whether the first line describes

19
00:01:04,001 --> 00:01:08,301
what the date means. And first of all we get
this nice little visualization on top

20
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:09,720
of our data,

21
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,960
but also what is happening is that all
of these columns are

22
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,609
automatically turned into something
like named ranges,

23
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:20,004
labeled by the first line. Labeled by the
headers,

24
00:01:20,004 --> 00:01:24,384
so we can use that in our formula. We
can say we want to count

25
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:30,219
TABLE1 and then we get all the columns in
our table, we want to have TABLE1

26
00:01:30,229 --> 00:01:34,389
maximum level and now the formula works.

27
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:38,005
And if we add another teacher to our roster,
let me re-add myself

28
00:01:38,005 --> 00:01:41,925
as a dance teacher, you see a little corner
thingy over there

29
00:01:42,029 --> 00:01:46,369
is going down with the table and that
shows where the table ends.

30
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,860
So as soon as you enter a new row in the
table,

31
00:01:50,013 --> 00:01:54,005
the table is extended and you don't have
to update the named range. So let

32
00:01:54,005 --> 00:01:55,985
me add another teacher to show you

33
00:01:56,043 --> 00:02:01,663
that little table thingy, the corner edge 
is showing you where the table ends.

34
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:06,018
So this is a solution that looks really
nice, we have all the benefits

35
00:02:06,018 --> 00:02:09,458
of named ranges, however we don't have to
change

36
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:13,072
anything in case we're adding teachers.

37
00:02:13,072 --> 00:02:17,052
But there's one thing that's super ugly,
actually I hope you have been

38
00:02:17,056 --> 00:02:22,033
shouting at your computer screens again:
"Oh no, I don't like the name of that

39
00:02:22,033 --> 00:02:23,013
table!

40
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:26,025
How can you have a video about named
ranges, names

41
00:02:26,097 --> 00:02:29,857
with a table that is called TABLE1? That is 
crazy!"

42
00:02:30,005 --> 00:02:34,016
You are right my friend, that is crazy.
Lets immediately change the name of the

43
00:02:34,061 --> 00:02:35,001
table, because

44
00:02:35,004 --> 00:02:40,120
this is super ugly. We can do that, as I 
showed you in a previous video with the

45
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,400
name manager,

46
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,000
but there is another solution as well,
to get rid of that

47
00:02:45,005 --> 00:02:49,474
ugly TABLE1. If we go back to the
teachers worksheet and select the data

48
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,200
table,

49
00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:53,068
we get an additional tab in the ribbon.
And there,

50
00:02:53,068 --> 00:02:57,099
we can easily change our table without
selecting anything.

51
00:02:57,099 --> 00:03:00,659
And you see that within the formulas
now also we get

52
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:03,519
table TEACHERS instead of TABLE1. We
don't have to

53
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:07,000
update anything and there's more we can
do

54
00:03:07,004 --> 00:03:10,684
in this ribbon tab. For instance we can add

55
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:15,500
slicers, this is really like a filter,
you see the logo is similar to a filter

56
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,940
but it's more interactive.

57
00:03:17,018 --> 00:03:20,717
You can click all the tariffs you want
and the data table will

58
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,003
update automatically. So this is a nice
little way

59
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:27,098
if you have changed your data into a
data table to interactively play

60
00:03:27,098 --> 00:03:30,198
with what is in your dataset.

61
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,005
And I encourage you, this is not really
an exercise, but I encourage you

62
00:03:35,005 --> 00:03:39,019
to download the spreadsheet from our
course page and to play with everything

63
00:03:39,064 --> 00:03:40,044
that's there.

64
00:03:40,045 --> 00:03:44,078
Because the data table allows for a lot
of playing, you can change the markup

65
00:03:44,078 --> 00:03:48,758
you can add a total columns or total rows,
so download the spreadsheet and play

66
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,036
with it, because it's

67
00:03:50,036 --> 00:03:54,516
really really nice to work with data
tables. See you in the next video!
