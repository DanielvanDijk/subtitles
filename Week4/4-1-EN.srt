00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:03,037
Hi, welcome back! For this week's exercises

2
00:00:03,082 --> 00:00:08,522
we use as running example a "Dance studio". 
So we have a number of teachers

3
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:12,058
in our Dance studio with names, ages, the
tariff,

4
00:00:12,058 --> 00:00:16,071
what they cost if we hire them, the
maximum level that they can teach

5
00:00:16,071 --> 00:00:20,331
and the preferred level, the level that they
like to teach most. For instance, Georgie here,

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,240

7
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:26,200
even though he can teach up to level 5,
he prefers to teach at level 1.

8
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,360
So, of course, on this data we have

9
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,940
we want to do some sort of analysis. So
let's start

10
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:37,299
by analysing for all of the levels we
have how many teachers do we have that

11
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,769
teach that level. So we make a list of
all the levels

12
00:00:40,809 --> 00:00:44,035
in our dance school - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 - and

13
00:00:44,035 --> 00:00:47,455
the Number of Teachers. And for this we
can use the COUNTIF

14
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:50,520
function, which is very similar to the
SUMIF function

15
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:53,940
that we have seen in previous videos. So
we're going to count

16
00:00:54,025 --> 00:00:57,785
for a given range, in the Teachers
worksheet,

17
00:00:58,007 --> 00:01:01,039
how many teachers are there for a given
level.

18
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:05,840
So we can just click the "Level". And what
this actually means,

19
00:01:06,002 --> 00:01:10,602
even though it's not really clear, is we
are calculating the number of teachers

20
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,814
that is exactly equal to this level

21
00:01:14,024 --> 00:01:17,029
in the first column. And that's actually not 
what we want,

22
00:01:17,029 --> 00:01:21,033
because we want to calculate who is able
to teach level 1,

23
00:01:21,033 --> 00:01:24,873
so someone who's able to teach level 3
is, of course,

24
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:28,878
also able to teach level 1. So what we want,

25
00:01:29,015 --> 00:01:33,395
instead of this equality in the COUNTIF,
is we would like to have

26
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,080
a comparison - we want to compare the
level

27
00:01:36,082 --> 00:01:39,096
to the level in the Teachers worksheet. 
And we can try this,

28
00:01:39,096 --> 00:01:42,976
but this unfortunately, even though it looks
really nice,

29
00:01:43,028 --> 00:01:47,075
is not allowed Excel syntax. We have
to make a little text out of this,

30
00:01:47,075 --> 00:01:50,835
a string, by adding quotes and ampersand
sign (&).

31
00:01:51,032 --> 00:01:54,045
And now in B we get the comparison what

32
00:01:54,045 --> 00:01:57,545
number of teachers we have that can
teach up to

33
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:01,053
a certain level, so everyone that can teach
level 1 or higher.

34
00:02:01,053 --> 00:02:04,055
And you see that this is actually what
we want,

35
00:02:04,055 --> 00:02:08,535
although there's one little mistake - in
that final column here, we have

36
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,940
4 and 5, we expect to get 4.

37
00:02:12,011 --> 00:02:16,036
However, we get 3. And I guess you've seen
my mistake because I forgot

38
00:02:16,036 --> 00:02:19,896
to insert the dollar signs ($) when I dragged
everything down.

39
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,020
So if I want to have it correctly,
I should not forget

40
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:27,940
to use those dollars. And what's also a little bit cumbersome here

41
00:02:28,072 --> 00:02:31,672
is if I would accidentally use another
column, let's say

42
00:02:32,056 --> 00:02:37,058
I make a mistake and I type 'E', 
it's very hard to see that I've made a

43
00:02:37,058 --> 00:02:38,878
mistake because 'D' and 'E'

44
00:02:39,014 --> 00:02:42,096
contain very similar values, it's hard to
see for me

45
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,900
where this formula points to. So these two
problems,

46
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:49,800
you shouldn't forget the
dollars

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,091
and it's hard to see where a cell
reference is pointing at, are nicely

48
00:02:53,097 --> 00:02:54,071
addressed

49
00:02:54,071 --> 00:02:58,431
by using Named Ranges, and that's a topic
of this week.

50
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,000
So let's go back to our example and see
what we can do

51
00:03:02,002 --> 00:03:05,073
if you want to change that reference
into a named range.

52
00:03:05,073 --> 00:03:09,077
We go to the Teachers worksheet and we just
select a bunch of cells

53
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,640
and type the name that we'd like to give
to that

54
00:03:13,002 --> 00:03:17,482
range of cells. Super easy, you just go in
the upper-left corner

55
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:22,420
and type the name. And if you've forgotten
where are certain named ranges located, you

56
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,940
can use this little drop-down box

57
00:03:24,051 --> 00:03:27,551
and it automatically points to the
named range.

58
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,980
And you can use this named range now in a
function

59
00:03:31,005 --> 00:03:34,039
instead of the cell references. So I
can select

60
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:38,039
the named range, even get a list
here of all the named ranges I have in my

61
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:39,017
spreadsheet,

62
00:03:39,017 --> 00:03:42,064
and I just drag it down. And now it's
really easy to see

63
00:03:42,064 --> 00:03:45,072
what I'm calculating.

64
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:49,075
It's easier because I can just read it, like
a book or like a sentence.

65
00:03:49,075 --> 00:03:52,091
I'm counting the maximum level of the
teachers.

66
00:03:52,091 --> 00:03:55,911
I don't have to figure out where exactly
I'm referencing to,

67
00:03:56,037 --> 00:03:58,477
and that's the power of named ranges.
