00:00:00,047 --> 00:00:04,039
So in this week's videos I've taught you
about Named Ranges.

2
00:00:04,039 --> 00:00:07,419
But, of course, we're still running our
Dance studio and the

3
00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:12,000
ultimate goal of this week's exercises is
to actually complete a planning

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,027
for our Dance studio. So let's have a
look at what we've done so far:

5
00:00:16,027 --> 00:00:20,400
we have improved our formula with
use of named range, we've made a data table

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,040

7
00:00:21,049 --> 00:00:25,076
out of the teachers, we have all the
information. There's one thing

8
00:00:25,076 --> 00:00:28,836
that we still need and that's the 
availability - what

9
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:32,389
teacher can teach on what days of the
week, because not all of them are

10
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,300
available

11
00:00:33,309 --> 00:00:37,429
all the time. But we have an issue now
here, because in this worksheet

12
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,969
the days of the week are in this

13
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:45,199
direction, whereas the availability
is in the other direction.

14
00:00:45,309 --> 00:00:50,589
Well, we can fix that by selecting this
data and copying it with Paste Special

15
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:53,840
in a transposed way, so all of the data
is flipped.

16
00:00:54,042 --> 00:01:00,022
And now we can copy it back to the original
position. But what has happened now

17
00:01:00,109 --> 00:01:04,309
is our worksheet has changed, but 
the named

18
00:01:04,339 --> 00:01:08,092
ranges have not. So the name is still
Horizontal levels,

19
00:01:08,092 --> 00:01:11,852
but in the spreadsheet it doesn't mean
Levels anymore,

20
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:16,037
it's actually days of the week now. And 
this is one of the risks,

21
00:01:16,082 --> 00:01:20,902
unfortunately, of using named range that
I would like to call

22
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:25,065
the Basmati Effect. Often in your
spreadsheet, but also in normal

23
00:01:25,065 --> 00:01:26,445
programming,

24
00:01:26,509 --> 00:01:30,034
it happens that your code changes, your
spreadsheet changes,

25
00:01:30,034 --> 00:01:33,814
but the values and names you have
given to them

26
00:01:34,002 --> 00:01:37,680
have not changed, and then you get things
like this where you have a container

27
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,400
saying

28
00:01:38,409 --> 00:01:42,081
"Rice" but actually it contains cookies. And
this is what happens in spreadsheets as

29
00:01:42,081 --> 00:01:45,659
well, and this is what has happened now in
our example,

30
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:51,009
where we have a name called Horizontal
Levels, but it actually contains

31
00:01:51,009 --> 00:01:54,093
days of the week. So your exercise for
this week, the first

32
00:01:54,093 --> 00:01:59,633
exercise, is to fix this. I would like
you to use the Name Manager to change

33
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,700
this name into

34
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,929
appropriate name

35
00:02:01,939 --> 00:02:05,099
but also to fix the formulas in such a
way that you are again

36
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:08,859
retrieving data, so that you get Xs

37
00:02:09,042 --> 00:02:14,111
on the spots of the days and the levels.
And the second assignment

38
00:02:14,489 --> 00:02:18,360
is to actually make the planning - so not
just the crosses, but

39
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,920
actual names for teachers that can teach

40
00:02:22,031 --> 00:02:27,291
at a given day for a given level. So that's
your assignment, use named ranges but

41
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:27,900
also

42
00:02:28,033 --> 00:02:33,013
all of the things we talked about in
previous videos to complete this planning.

43
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,200
Good luck!
