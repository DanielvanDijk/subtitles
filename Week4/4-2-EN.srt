00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:05,320
In the previous video we've introduced a
Named Range - for a certain column in our

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,000
spreadsheet.

3
00:00:06,001 --> 00:00:09,052
But, of course, as you remember from one of
the previous videos,

4
00:00:09,061 --> 00:00:13,381
spreadsheets have a very long life-span,
they can live up to five

5
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:19,034
years. So at one point, in our little dance
studio we are going to hire a new teacher

6
00:00:19,034 --> 00:00:19,035

7
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:23,032
and if we do that, if we would just
enter this new teacher

8
00:00:23,032 --> 00:00:27,068
into our Teachers worksheet, let's say
his name is Harry and he is 25,

9
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,100
we enter all his data, unfortunately

10
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:34,077
if we then go to our Planning worksheet
the formulas

11
00:00:34,077 --> 00:00:37,086
will not have been updated. We are still
calculating

12
00:00:37,086 --> 00:00:41,986
based on the old named range, you see
there is no change

13
00:00:42,036 --> 00:00:45,956
in the values here. And it is
understandable - if you go back to

14
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:48,069
the Teachers worksheet and select the named
range,

15
00:00:48,069 --> 00:00:52,609
from the drop-down list you see that
the Maximum Level

16
00:00:52,609 --> 00:00:56,001
is not including the last line in
our worksheet.

17
00:00:56,001 --> 00:01:01,019
So if you want to update a given named
range, you can use the name Manager as

18
00:01:01,028 --> 00:01:03,037
you see here, so the names are not fixed,

19
00:01:03,289 --> 00:01:07,301
you can always update them if your
spreadsheet is changing. 

20
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:11,300
And now you see, if you select Max. Level again,
all of the rows are included in the

21
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:15,000
named range and also our formulas are
updated. So

22
00:01:15,006 --> 00:01:19,486
you can update your named range every time you
make a change to a spreadsheet.

23
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,940
However, this is dangerous, because I'm
sure,

24
00:01:23,029 --> 00:01:26,036
at one point, you will forget about

25
00:01:26,036 --> 00:01:29,976
all of the named ranges you have in your
worksheet and you'll forget to update one

26
00:01:30,032 --> 00:01:31,952
of them if you enter new data.

27
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,060
So although it's possible with the named
range Manager

28
00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:39,065
to change your named ranges, this is not a
preferred solution - you want to have your

29
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:40,405
spreadsheet

30
00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:44,949
as automated as possible. An alternative
solution

31
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:48,045
is using an entire column

32
00:01:48,045 --> 00:01:52,065
for your named range. You can do that if
we go back to the named

33
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,025
range manager. You don't need to use a
fixed

34
00:01:55,025 --> 00:01:58,078
column, you can say "all the rows in my
column".

35
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:01,082
This is allowed syntax and now you'll see
that

36
00:02:01,082 --> 00:02:05,360
the whole column is indeed included in
the named range.

37
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,940
And if you add another teacher now,
let's say we add

38
00:02:09,069 --> 00:02:12,489
a teacher called Shelly, the formulas will

39
00:02:12,579 --> 00:02:17,004
be updated to include this new teacher,
because, of course, it's calculating

40
00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:20,504
the entire column. So this is a good
solution,

41
00:02:20,689 --> 00:02:23,691
however, there is also a downside to
this solution,

42
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:26,889
because what happens now, if you want to
do some analysis

43
00:02:27,109 --> 00:02:31,789
on the Teachers worksheet, so let's say
we want to calculate something like

44
00:02:31,939 --> 00:02:35,459
the most common level we have in our
group of teachers.

45
00:02:35,469 --> 00:02:40,859
So we say "Most Common Level" and there's
a formula for this in Excel called MODE,

46
00:02:40,859 --> 00:02:45,059
really nice function that you can use to
calculate the most common value

47
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:51,019
in a bunch of cells. So this works, we
know now that the most common level

48
00:02:51,019 --> 00:02:55,459
in our group of teachers is 3.
However, because our named ranges

49
00:02:55,469 --> 00:02:57,504
are covering the entire column

50
00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:02,379
this MODE will now also be included in
our calculation and that's not what

51
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,140
we want.

52
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,225
So, yes, you can use an entire column,

53
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:10,709
however, then all these cells underneath our
little data table

54
00:03:10,889 --> 00:03:14,880
are not usable anymore, they're sort of
"blocked", because we cannot put

55
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,209
calculations in them

56
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:20,000
because the other calculations will use
that data as well.

57
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,959
So, we are stuck here and in the next
video I will show you

58
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:25,479
how to solve this problem.
