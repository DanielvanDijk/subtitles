1
00:00:00,071 --> 00:00:04,051
Array formulas. We've looked at how to
analyze

2
00:00:04,062 --> 00:00:08,063
the data for the quality of the
exams, not necessarily looking at the

3
00:00:08,072 --> 00:00:11,972
quality of students. We're looking at
what questions in our exam

4
00:00:12,007 --> 00:00:15,007
contribute towards the end marks. And I
think we can

5
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:19,680
say that we've come to a conclusion that
question 2 doesn't really help.

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,057
It's not different from question 1, so
of course we can just

7
00:00:23,057 --> 00:00:26,697
clear content, throw everything away. But

8
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,739
that's not what I want. I manually inputted
everything, so I want to keep

9
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:31,820
the values

10
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,880
but still I want to have the ability to
analyze.

11
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,640
So I could filter, but

12
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:42,609
the way the filtering works in Excel, is
you can only filter in this direction

13
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,119
you can only filter on rows, and you
can't filter on columns.

14
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:50,000
And that's exactly what I want, because I
want to filter out one question and I

15
00:00:50,003 --> 00:00:51,283
want to filter out

16
00:00:51,309 --> 00:00:54,800
one student. So what I need to do

17
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,960
is change my data, transpose my data
into being in a different direction.

18
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:05,003
So how to do that? What I can do is I
made another worksheet,

19
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:08,057
called exam transposed where I want to transpose
my data.

20
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,714
Excel has a function for that I can just
say

21
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,712
TRANSPOSE() type it in the formula bar.
There we go, 

22
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,799
TRANSPOSE() and I select the array of data

23
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,839
that I want you to transpose and then I
hit control shift enter.

24
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,760
So what I get now is just

25
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:31,420
one cell because as we've seen in a
previous video I haven't given Excel

26
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,020
the room, the space

27
00:01:33,021 --> 00:01:36,430
to plot the entire array. So if I want to
have

28
00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:40,979
everything transposed, I need to make
sure there's enough room in my worksheet

29
00:01:41,004 --> 00:01:44,544
to plot everything. So how much room do we need?

30
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,000
Well we have 16 rows so that will be 16
columns,

31
00:01:48,009 --> 00:01:52,218
and we have 14 columns currently, so there
will be 14

32
00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:56,519
rows. So if we go back to our transpose
worksheet we make sure that we make enough

33
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,020
room

34
00:01:57,029 --> 00:02:02,649
for everything, and then we can use the
TRANSPOSE() function with control shift enter,

35
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:06,900
making it into an array formula and now we
get the result of the entire array.

36
00:02:07,005 --> 00:02:11,845
So what was previously one row is now in
a transposed version

37
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:16,000
one column. So why am I showing you this?

38
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:19,008
Well first of all, we want to have the
results in a different direction

39
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:23,004
but I also want to point out an
important difference in Excel functions.

40
00:02:23,004 --> 00:02:26,033
Some functions are array functions

41
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:31,001
for instance, TRANSPOSE(). If you enter it
you already see as an argument

42
00:02:31,001 --> 00:02:34,700
you need to put in an array so the
transpose is 

43
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:38,025
an array function in a sense. It always
operates on an array,

44
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:41,705
there's no other way. You can't put in a
number, it doesn't know how to transpose

45
00:02:41,705 --> 00:02:42,600
a number.

46
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:46,063
However other functions like the
subtract function

47
00:02:46,063 --> 00:02:49,703
that we've seen in a previous video they
not are

48
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:54,004
inherently array formulas, but you can
make them into array formulas 

49
00:02:54,004 --> 00:02:57,006
by giving them a range as an argument
and then

50
00:02:57,006 --> 00:03:00,946
they can be made to work on all the
pairs. So some functions

51
00:03:01,034 --> 00:03:04,213
are array and others can be made array

52
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:07,759
and that's also what the exercises of
this video will be about.
