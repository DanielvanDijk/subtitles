00:00:00,053 --> 00:00:03,133
This week we're going to talk about
array formulas,

2
00:00:03,189 --> 00:00:06,039
let's have a look at the example of this
week, where we

3
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:09,399
are looking at exam results for a teacher.

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,020
We interrupt this recording for an important message about Types

5
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,060
Today we're going to talk about

6
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:21,440
type theory, because it's super important
in order for us to be able to understand

7
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,720
this week's material.

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,360
So we're going to start really really
basic, so don't worry.

9
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:33,920
This is easy, right?

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,100
2 plus 3 is 5, but these are
not just numbers. They also have the type

11
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,940
of being a number and I'm going to

12
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:45,700
annotate all types with a different
colour. So what we're calculating here

13
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,700
is a number and a number

14
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:55,700
result in a number. But this is not how
we write formulas in Excel, we can write

15
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:56,540
numbers

16
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:00,040
in a formula, but we can also use
cells. So let's have a look

17
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:05,040
at how that looks. 

18
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,820
So we have these two cells in a
spreadsheet and we can say A1

19
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,980
plus A2 in this case

20
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:20,460
is also 5. So what are the types
here?

21
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:25,180
Well 5 is a number, that's easy. But
A1 is not a number,

22
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:28,399
it's a cell, it's a reference to a number

23
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,700
so let's draw it like this

24
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,980
and say something that contains a number and 

25
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,900
something that contains a number -   we
can add the numbers,

26
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:43,760
and then we can get a number. There are
different types in Excel as well

27
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:51,660
it's not just numbers. Suppose we have
this in the cell

28
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:55,080
a string, a piece of text. We can
calculate on text

29
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,400
as well.

30
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,060
So what are the types here?

31
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,120
We have again something that contains

32
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,120
a text and the result of the function

33
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,134
is a text. So these functions all

34
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,920
take in the same values a number
resulting in a number

35
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,091
or text resulting in a text.

36
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,400
But there are also functions that can
take in a certain type

37
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,020
but return a different type. Let's have a
look at how that looks like.

38
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,660
For instance if we are calculating with dates...

39
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,860
We have a date in our spreadsheet now and
we can calculate with dates as well.

40
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,340
We've seen that in the past.

41
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,620
We could for instance calculate

42
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:59,960
the month of A1, which would result in
1.

43
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,340
So here you see an example of something
that takes in

44
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:07,720
a certain value, it takes in a container,

45
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,660
something that contains a cell, containing
a date,

46
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:14,100
but it results in a number. So there

47
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:17,920
you take in a date, but you return a
number. So sometimes the types of

48
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,620
inputs are different from the types of
the output. They don't necessarily have

49
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,560
to match.

50
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,900
So now let's have a look at

51
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,620
the most complicated construction that we're
going to look at

52
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:34,240
in these week's videos. It's still
pretty basic I hope.

53
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,020
Suppose we have a range we have 1,

54
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:42,298
2, 3 in a spreadsheet we can
calculate on that. We know how to do that

55
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,160
so we can say something like the SUM()
of

56
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,580
A1 to A3

57
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,980
which in this case is 6. So what are the
types here?

58
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:57,720
Let's start with 6 because that's
super easy, 6 is a number,

59
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,900
we know that. But what do we have here?
We could say

60
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,920
we have three

61
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:08,760
number containers, three values that have
a number.

62
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,846
But of course it doesn't necessarily
have to be three.

63
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:17,620
We can also say now we're summing 
until

64
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:23,840
A5. Would that give the function a
different type? It would have to add

65
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,100
another container here and one here.

66
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,080
So we're not going to do that, this is
not the way that we are going to write

67
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,000
this down.

68
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,060
What we are saying here is we're summing
over a list

69
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,420
of numbers so the type, as I will write
that down

70
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:43,440
in subsequent videos is a list of
numbers

71
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,440
and the result of the function is
a number.

72
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:50,400
And this is very important to remember
for the remainder of this week's videos,

73
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,600
that was the end of the typing
secrets.
