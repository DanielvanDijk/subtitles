1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,480
In a previous video we looked at array
formulas.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:07,160
More specifically, we've looked at how to
transpose our data

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:11,920
so that we can filter it for questions
that we don't want to have in an exam anymore.

4
00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:15,539
Our data is prepared now, it's in the
right way.

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,060
So let's filter it, we can go to the filter
button, select our data

6
00:00:19,067 --> 00:00:24,000
and say: Hey we don't want all the data,
we don't want all of the questions

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,034
we only want to have everything

8
00:00:27,034 --> 00:00:30,414
beside the second row. But unfortunately

9
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,940
we still have the same result, because we
have transposed

10
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:38,300
everything including the last column

11
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,020
which is now the last row, so don't worry
you think,

12
00:00:41,027 --> 00:00:44,559
we can just delete it. That doesn't work,

13
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:47,479
you cannot change part of an arrayformula.

14
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,600
It's impossible once you have selected
an area

15
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,689
that's meant for an array, you cannot
delete cells in it.

16
00:00:54,699 --> 00:00:58,399
And this is a good, because you don't
want to accidentally overwrite part of

17
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,020
your array

18
00:00:59,028 --> 00:01:02,359
by hitting the keyboard with your elbow.
But in this case,

19
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:06,599
we don't want to have the final column
anymore, we want to add new calculations,

20
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,440
So what we need to do is use the same

21
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,540
region again but we with one row less and put
the

22
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,560
array formula in again. So

23
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,015
the only way we can delete the values is:
delete everything,

24
00:01:20,015 --> 00:01:25,355
delete the entire array formula and then
paste it again

25
00:01:25,369 --> 00:01:28,869
using one row less. It's a bit cumbersome

26
00:01:28,869 --> 00:01:32,021
so if you want to change an array you have
to change everything.

27
00:01:32,021 --> 00:01:37,259
But there we have it. So now we can add the
SUM() function ourself,

28
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:41,036
based on the transposed data. We just
add a SUM()

29
00:01:41,036 --> 00:01:44,796
of the entire column. There we go, no
worries.

30
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,960
And we drag it.

31
00:01:48,082 --> 00:01:49,522
Yep, there it is.

32
00:01:50,007 --> 00:01:54,038
So now we can filter, we are entirely
prepared, we go to filter we remove

33
00:01:54,038 --> 00:01:57,618
the second question from the list of
questions,

34
00:01:57,619 --> 00:02:01,078
and it works. Apparently, it doesn't.

35
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:05,098
The calculation even though a row is
filtered out,

36
00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:11,109
is still calculating on the entire
column. so we can not use a function to

37
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,016
filter, because it will still

38
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,880
calculate the entire column unfortunately.

39
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,560
I hope you're screaming right now, I
really hope

40
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,040
that on the other side of the video you
are saying this:

41
00:02:25,047 --> 00:02:29,680
Hey, but I know why this isn't working
because formulas are

42
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,569
not for analysis, formulas are for
calculation

43
00:02:33,579 --> 00:02:36,979
if you want to do analysis you
should do something else.

44
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:40,014
For instance a pivot table,

45
00:02:40,014 --> 00:02:43,113
indeed. Okay, okay, okay, I hear you.

46
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:48,245
Let's try to do our analysis with a pivot
table. We get rid of the formulas

47
00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:52,679
they are not for analysis. We get rid of
the filter and we select all the data

48
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,780
and put it

49
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:57,020
into a pivot table. Filter

50
00:02:57,025 --> 00:03:00,445
can go, we select all the data.

51
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:04,000
Oh yeah, I've changed the student number
to one two three four instead of

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,880
the very long student numbers, because
that will make the pivot table a bit too big.

53
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:14,800
Let's go, we add pivot table. Yep, there we go.

54
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:20,980
select the pivot table and we put
it on a new worksheet that I have just

55
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:21,980
made.

56
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,015
Select the data and we have a pivot table.

57
00:03:24,015 --> 00:03:28,069
So now we can filter right? We can say we
want all of the students, these are student

58
00:03:28,069 --> 00:03:29,649
numbers now,

59
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:34,049
all the sums of all the students. 
Click, click, click.

60
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,420
Yep and we can add a filter

61
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:42,016
on what questions to use, super easy if
you've seen the week

62
00:03:42,016 --> 00:03:45,596
about the pivot tables, you know how to do
this. We can just select

63
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:50,579
what questions we want. However as you
see, it's pretty hard to compare the

64
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,560
different scenarios with each other.

65
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,200
Now this is 55 if I change a value

66
00:03:56,209 --> 00:03:59,869
it changes, but what I would like to have
is have the

67
00:03:59,869 --> 00:04:02,095
scenarios side by side. One row for

68
00:04:02,095 --> 00:04:06,035
the exam with question 2 included and 
one row

69
00:04:06,042 --> 00:04:10,013
for the exam without question 2, without
everything

70
00:04:10,013 --> 00:04:13,027
swapping all the time. If I do that

71
00:04:13,027 --> 00:04:16,820
the only way I could do that is to make
two pivot tables with two different

72
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:17,820
filters. 

73
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,999
And then of course we're running into
the duplication problem again.

74
00:04:21,002 --> 00:04:25,007
There's another downside of using
pivot table for this analysis,

75
00:04:25,007 --> 00:04:29,267
if we go to the table field settings down
here,

76
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,400
there's a limited number of functions we
can use.

77
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,260
So there is SUM(), AVERAGE(), MIN(), MAX(), but not

78
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:40,960
all of Excel's I think 350+ 
built-in functions are there.

79
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,963
There's a limited set a functions that we
can use. So if we're summing the exam

80
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:46,037
results that's fine,

81
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:51,080
but if we want take differeent quartals for instance,
if we want to use the median

82
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:55,380
if we want to use the mode, then
there's no way that we can do that with

83
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,460
a pivot table.

84
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:01,680
So in conclusion, yes formulas are for
calculation and not for analysis,

85
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,760
however there are some limitations to
what you can do

86
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:09,840
with pivot tables, because they don't
support everything and also they don't

87
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,729
really support

88
00:05:10,729 --> 00:05:14,560
scenario analysis in which I want to
compare two different filters with each

89
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,420
other.

90
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:18,400
And that's where you're going to need
array formulas.
