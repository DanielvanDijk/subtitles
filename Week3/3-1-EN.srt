00:00:00,057 --> 00:00:03,637
Hi welcome to this week's videos. This
week we're

2
00:00:04,023 --> 00:00:09,028
only going to talk about pivot tables
and I'm going to guess that this is a little

3
00:00:09,028 --> 00:00:10,041
bit of a relief to you.

4
00:00:10,041 --> 00:00:13,761
Because if you did last week's exercise
this is probably

5
00:00:13,929 --> 00:00:18,420
more or less what you ended up with so
I'm going to assume that you have seen

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,600
enough new formulas for a week.

7
00:00:20,619 --> 00:00:25,075
So this week no new formulas, we're
only going to talk about how to analyze

8
00:00:25,075 --> 00:00:27,035
your data using pivot tables. 

9
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,859
Also we're not doing the
hardware store anymore.

10
00:00:31,023 --> 00:00:34,192
I think we've seen enough of the
hardware store for a little bit, so this

11
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:34,960
week

12
00:00:34,969 --> 00:00:39,429
we're going to be running a bar. The
spreadsheet for a bar is a little bit

13
00:00:39,429 --> 00:00:42,200
similar to the hardware case because we
again have

14
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,095
an export from a register system where we
keep track of everything that we sell in the bar.

16
00:00:46,095 --> 00:00:50,915
But we have some more information in this
case because in addition to the date,

17
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:54,617
the time, the type of beer that we're
selling, and the quantity,

18
00:00:54,699 --> 00:00:57,879
we're also keeping track of who buys the
beers.

19
00:00:57,949 --> 00:01:01,169
So let's assume all our customers have
some sort of loyalty card,

20
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:04,068
so we know exactly who buys what at which
time

21
00:01:04,068 --> 00:01:07,868
and that of course allows us to do a lot
of nice analysis.

22
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,680
So with this data,

23
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:14,960
we also have a list of all the beers that
we're selling in another worksheet, 

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
all the beers that are there and let's
assume we just Googled

25
00:01:18,001 --> 00:01:21,026
for all the beers and we found a nice
list of beers.

26
00:01:21,035 --> 00:01:24,067
So of course a question that we could
ask ourselves is:

27
00:01:24,067 --> 00:01:27,907
How many of each of the beer types have
we been selling?

28
00:01:28,035 --> 00:01:31,875
So we can use a COUNTIF() function for
that, I'm sure this is a pretty

29
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,078
familiar function by now.

30
00:01:33,078 --> 00:01:37,018
We look in the register log how many
times have we

31
00:01:37,189 --> 00:01:40,059
sold this specific beer? 

32
00:01:40,059 --> 00:01:44,639
Simple right? You already know that. 
So question: is this formula

33
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:50,219
actually correct? Can you spot anything that
might be wrong with this formula? 

34
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,419
I'll give you one second to think about it.

35
00:01:55,074 --> 00:01:59,714
So I hope you were yelling at your
computer screen while I was pausing,

36
00:02:00,001 --> 00:02:02,033
because obviously there are few things

37
00:02:02,042 --> 00:02:06,762
that are wrong with this formula. The
first thing is that beers prefix,

38
00:02:06,939 --> 00:02:10,067
we don't need it. Excel adds it always

39
00:02:10,067 --> 00:02:13,867
if you switch worksheets, but it's actually
better to remove it.

40
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:18,060
But something else is wrong with this
function, I don't think COUNTIF() is the

41
00:02:18,069 --> 00:02:18,909
right thing

42
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:22,079
to use, because we have a quantity there.

43
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:25,479
So what we do with a COUNTIF() is just
count

44
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:28,940
all the rows that are there. But that's not
what we want.

45
00:02:29,014 --> 00:02:32,079
We want to use a SUMIF() function,
because we want to have the sum

46
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:37,579
of all those quantities we are selling.
So we have to change our function a little

47
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,380
bit,

48
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,860
because now we also need to tell Excel
what the column is

49
00:02:42,002 --> 00:02:45,026
that were summing. If we add that function
then

50
00:02:45,044 --> 00:02:52,844
the formula is correct.
However this formula is correct, but something

51
00:02:53,029 --> 00:02:57,086
is a little bit inconvenient here,
because you see here in this time sort

52
00:02:57,086 --> 00:02:57,906
column

53
00:02:58,044 --> 00:03:01,844
we only have zeros at this point because
the list

54
00:03:02,032 --> 00:03:05,034
of all the possible beers that we can sell is so
long

55
00:03:05,034 --> 00:03:08,874
that the first ones just are not
occurring.

56
00:03:09,002 --> 00:03:12,004
So I have to click Sort. I have to go

57
00:03:12,022 --> 00:03:15,029
to the ribbon, click sort, say I want to have

58
00:03:15,092 --> 00:03:19,752
only the largest numbers on top. And
then as you can see

59
00:03:20,006 --> 00:03:24,031
we can see what beers we have exactly
been selling. So it's quite a hassle to

60
00:03:24,031 --> 00:03:25,491
get everything done.

61
00:03:25,549 --> 00:03:29,001
And in addition to that we could ask

62
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:33,038
more difficult question. Suppose our boss
comes in and even though we changed our

63
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:37,807
business from a hardware store to a beer
shop we still have the same boss isn't

64
00:03:38,002 --> 00:03:38,881
that interesting.

65
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:42,339
And she asks very interesting questions
like: What beers

66
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:45,563
have been most sold after 11 p.m.?

67
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:49,043
Those are probably interesting to know
because you want to know what beers are

68
00:03:49,043 --> 00:03:50,072
popular early in

69
00:03:50,072 --> 00:03:53,792
in the evening at what beers are more
popular late at night.

70
00:03:54,016 --> 00:03:57,059
So suppose we have to add an analysis
like that

71
00:03:57,059 --> 00:04:01,358
is going to be a little bit cumbersome.
Because first of all we have to add

72
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,560
another column

73
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,840
saying what what times are after eleven.

74
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,400
And your first intuition might be to use

75
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:13,048
an IF() function there, but it's actually
not needed. You can just use a comparison

76
00:04:13,048 --> 00:04:13,968
function

77
00:04:14,015 --> 00:04:18,784
as a proper formula in Excel. So here 
we try

78
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:23,033
a first attempt, we say if the time is
bigger than 23.

79
00:04:23,033 --> 00:04:27,041
However that's not really working,
because you see here in this case, we

80
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:28,088
have 11 p.m.

81
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:33,740
However we still get FALSE. And the reason
for that is the way that Excel works with

82
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,740
times, is that it saves the time

83
00:04:36,052 --> 00:04:42,053
as the fraction of the day. So 5 p.m. is
more or less like 0.7 here.

84
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,846
You can see that if you change the time
into a number.

85
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:50,498
So for proper comparison with times we
have to compare with a time.

86
00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:55,033
So we have the time, 23 hours, 0 minutes and 0 seconds.

87
00:04:55,033 --> 00:04:59,373
and if we use that as a comparison then
we actually get TRUE here

88
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:04,097
in the case where the time is above eleven. 
So I was cheating a little bit. I told

89
00:05:04,097 --> 00:05:07,977
you in the beginning of the video that I
wouldn't show you any new formulas.

90
00:05:08,031 --> 00:05:12,260
This is a new formula, but I hope
you're going to let this one go, because

91
00:05:12,539 --> 00:05:14,039
it's very simple and it's

92
00:05:14,099 --> 00:05:19,115
only for time comparison. So with this
function we can now add our analysis,

93
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:20,013
because we can

94
00:05:20,013 --> 00:05:23,042
change our time sold from a SUMIF()

95
00:05:23,159 --> 00:05:27,078
into a SUMIFS() where we use multiple
conditions to sum.

96
00:05:27,078 --> 00:05:31,058
We have to change our formula a little bit,
because how the SUMIFS() works

97
00:05:31,065 --> 00:05:34,078
is, we get first the column that we are
summing,

98
00:05:34,078 --> 00:05:38,038
and then a list of conditions. So we picked
the quantity column first,

99
00:05:38,075 --> 00:05:42,575
and then we say we want to have the name of 
the beer,

100
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:46,660
as the first condition. It has to be
equal to the first column of the beers

101
00:05:46,669 --> 00:05:47,389
worksheet,

102
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:50,099
and then the second condition is the
time

103
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:55,019
after 11 p.m. has to be TRUE. 

104
00:05:55,082 --> 00:06:01,942
So it's quite a long formula, but it gets 
the job done. However as you can see here,

105
00:06:02,038 --> 00:06:06,858
the column is now not sorted yet, 
because it is still sorted

106
00:06:07,008 --> 00:06:10,013
in the original order, so if you want to sort
it

107
00:06:10,013 --> 00:06:13,232
again we have to click sort. Here you can
see

108
00:06:13,349 --> 00:06:18,002
those values are not properly sorted yet.
So if we click sort now

109
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:21,037
something strange happens. Here you see:

110
00:06:21,037 --> 00:06:24,052
Hey, that is not the correct value! The
links

111
00:06:24,052 --> 00:06:29,053
again, have been updated and that's
because we forgot this time

112
00:06:29,062 --> 00:06:33,682
I hope you were screaming again at the computer
screen. We forgot to remove that beers

113
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,709
prefix. So if you remove that

114
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:41,119
then we get the correct result. But that
was a lot of work right?

115
00:06:41,389 --> 00:06:45,769
A simple query: what beer is best
sold after 11 p.m.?

116
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,941
We have to add another column, change our
formula

117
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:52,172
and make sure that we don't forget to
remove the prefixes

118
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:57,699
and that we don't forget to sort. So what I hope
that you take away from these videos,

119
00:06:57,699 --> 00:07:02,059
is formulas are meant for calculations. If
you're calculating 

120
00:07:02,219 --> 00:07:05,027
a sum or an average a formula is fine.

121
00:07:05,027 --> 00:07:08,787
But as soon as you start to do really
analysis, you're

122
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:12,421
diving into your data, you're asking
yourself questions: like

123
00:07:12,529 --> 00:07:15,083
what's the most popular beer on a
Saturday

124
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:18,683
if the temperature is below zero degrees?
Something like that.

125
00:07:19,012 --> 00:07:23,752
If you're analyzing your data formulas
quickly go out of hand. And I think you

126
00:07:24,001 --> 00:07:25,460
saw in this example that

127
00:07:25,469 --> 00:07:30,005
that just happens very quickly. So 
remember formulas are not for analysis

128
00:07:30,005 --> 00:07:33,033
and of course then what is for analysis?

129
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:37,597
Pivot tables! More about pivot tables in
the next few videos.
