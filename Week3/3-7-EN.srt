1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:04,330
So in a previous video we did an
analysis where we looked at

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:07,500
what countries do our most popular beers
stem from?

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,000
But of course if we're talking about
geographical data

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,480
like countries, maybe we could plot that
on a map.

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,500
And in our worksheet we also have
information

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:22,310
about latitude and longitude, so wouldn't
it be cool if we would have a map of the world

7
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:22,970

8
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:27,760
that would show exactly where the breweries
are where our most popular beers come from.

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,189

10
00:00:28,189 --> 00:00:32,099
Maybe we can plan a field trip to the
closest most popular brewery.

11
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:37,670
so luckily there's a super cool thing in
Excel 2013 that's called

12
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:41,290
PowerMap. We're going to use that to do
exactly that, plot

13
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:44,579
our beers on a map. So you just

14
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:47,660
click power map when you have 
installed this plug-in,

15
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:51,570
and then you get a map right there and
all the data 

16
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,940
from our data model from PowerPivot is
right there.

17
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:59,379
So what we can do is drag
just the breweries on and

18
00:00:59,379 --> 00:01:04,180
you get  little dots for all of the
breweries. But this is based on the entire

19
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,010
list of breweries, 

20
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:08,760
on the one worksheet. Not yet on the
connected list

21
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,330
connected to what we are selling.
In order for us to do that,

22
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:16,110
we need to drag the quantity in, very
similar to how we would do it in a

23
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,350
normal pivot table.

24
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:21,729
And what we get then is all the
brewery with the quantity that we

25
00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:24,189
are selling in our bar so we can see
that this

26
00:01:24,189 --> 00:01:28,720
brewery right here this is the La Trappe
brewery is kinda close to where our bar is.

27
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,040
Let's assume our bar is in Delft, where this
university is too.

28
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,290
So we have a pretty popular brewery that is
quite close 

29
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:40,540
to Delft, that would be nice for a field trip.
So what I've done now is, I have also added the

30
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:41,250
time

31
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,659
dimension and you get a little animation
where you can see

32
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:47,869
during that time, during the opening hours of
our bar

33
00:01:47,869 --> 00:01:51,640
you see the beers basically being drunk
by the people

34
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,640
in the bar and you can play that time as an
animation.

35
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:00,950
What we can furthermore do, is add a
category so you see what type of beers

36
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:04,450
stem from what brewery. So you see here

37
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:08,119
let me remove that, you see that blue is
a certain type of beer,

38
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:11,580
and orange is not our type of beer and
you see a right on your map.

39
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:16,160
No formulas needed. You just drag your data in,
you say

40
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,930
these are the breweries, the
quantities and the categories

41
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:24,739
and you get your visualisation right
on the map. So let's have a look at the

42
00:02:24,739 --> 00:02:27,670
rest of the world we don't need to
concentrate on Europe. If you look at the

43
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:29,739
US we see another interesting

44
00:02:29,739 --> 00:02:33,129
visualization, we see that here the breweries
of which

45
00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:37,110
two of the beers that are being sold
are really popular and here's an

46
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:40,780
area in the US where a lot of breweries
are popular.

47
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:44,060
So maybe if we want to have a field trip
very far away

48
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:47,430
this would be an interesting area
of the US to actually go to.

49
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:51,010
And again and I can't stress this enough we
didn't use 

50
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:55,840
any formulas if we just load all our
data into the PowerPivot data model 

51
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,080
we can then use PowerMap if it's
geographical data

52
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,750
to plot everything on a map just by
selecting the fields

53
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:06,870
that we want to use. And that closes the
entire week

54
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:12,040
to show you the power of pivot tables
little use of formulas, you can just

55
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,790
analyze your data by clicking and
dragging

56
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:17,159
isn't that nice? See you next week
