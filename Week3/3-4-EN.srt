00:00:00,064 --> 00:00:03,824
Hi, welcome back! In previous videos we've
looked at

2
00:00:03,939 --> 00:00:06,094
pivot tables extensively, and in the previous
video

3
00:00:06,094 --> 00:00:09,854
we looked at how to use different
functions: like an AVERAGE function

4
00:00:10,017 --> 00:00:11,029
instead of a SUM.

5
00:00:11,029 --> 00:00:14,458
And there's one more function that I'd
really like to talk about and this

6
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,725
is called the distinct count.

7
00:00:16,779 --> 00:00:21,055
So it's different from a COUNTIF() or a 
normal COUNT() function, where you just

8
00:00:21,055 --> 00:00:25,063
count the number of lines. This distinct count

9
00:00:25,063 --> 00:00:28,923
counts the number of different customers
in this case

10
00:00:29,038 --> 00:00:34,039
that have bought a specific beer. So if
you use a distinct count, you can see

11
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:37,061
what beer is popular with a lot of
different people.

12
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,669
And that's really a different measure
from a COUNT() and in the exercises

13
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:45,036
we will talk about this distinct count
a little bit more so this is why I

14
00:00:45,036 --> 00:00:46,235
wanted to show it to you.

15
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,095
But there's one thing in the whole
pivot table view

16
00:00:49,095 --> 00:00:53,695
that we haven't really looked at yet.
And that's this columns, right here.

17
00:00:53,739 --> 00:00:57,017
So we filtered, we have used different
functions, different values,

18
00:00:57,017 --> 00:01:01,078
but we haven't added columns to the mix.
And columns in a pivot table

19
00:01:01,078 --> 00:01:04,738
literally add another dimension to your
data analysis.

20
00:01:05,056 --> 00:01:09,065
Because in previous videos we've only
looked at this row dimension

21
00:01:09,065 --> 00:01:12,865
and now we're also going to add columns
in our pivot table.

22
00:01:13,064 --> 00:01:16,824
So let's have a look at how that goes. We
don't need the guest ID

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,096
and the count anymore,
what we're going to add

24
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,760
as rows is all the different types and
what we're going to add

25
00:01:25,021 --> 00:01:28,320
as the calculation is 

26
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:33,020
the count of the quantity.
So what we see now,

27
00:01:33,025 --> 00:01:36,780
per time of the day: how many quantities
have we sold?

28
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,020
And then we drag in columns. So we add
the guest IDs

29
00:01:41,028 --> 00:01:44,057
as columns. Let's zoom out a little bit so
we can

30
00:01:44,057 --> 00:01:48,377
better see what happens. So what we see now is
overview of

31
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,096
per customer at the time of the day what

32
00:01:51,096 --> 00:01:55,416
is actually being sold. So you can see
this first customer right here,

33
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:59,080
he is a regular. He buys beers at 5 p.m., 
at 7 p.m.

34
00:01:59,082 --> 00:02:03,882
Whereas the second customers is different,
he either buys before dinner

35
00:02:04,001 --> 00:02:08,840
or after dinner. And the third customer
again is different, because he only comes in

36
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:08,840

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,049
late at night. And by analyzing your data
in this way you really

38
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:16,068
get an overview of what exactly
happened, what times,

39
00:02:16,068 --> 00:02:19,808
what customers are doing what? 
So this is not really

40
00:02:20,004 --> 00:02:24,744
meant for having an overview
analysis, it is meant for really diving into

41
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:26,000
your data. So you can exactly see

42
00:02:26,042 --> 00:02:31,068
who is buying what at what time.
So let's add another example of

43
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:35,328
using columns, so instead of using
guest ID's we're now going to use

44
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,020
beer ID's

45
00:02:36,054 --> 00:02:40,071
but we're keeping time as rows. So now
we come profile beers.

46
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,720
We see that this first beer right here,
is really a beer

47
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,220
for early in the evening, where our
second beer is a beer

48
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,000
that's been sold late at night more. So
by

49
00:02:51,002 --> 00:02:55,023
adding columns to your pivot table
you're not summarizing anymore

50
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:59,021
it's more like profiling what exactly
happens in our data.

51
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:04,060
And this, again, allows you to really gain
a more detailed understanding

52
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,300
of what is happening in your data.
