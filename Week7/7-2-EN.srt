1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,000
So we are calculating the Bacon number of

2
00:00:03,004 --> 00:00:06,006
bunch of different actors in our
spreadsheet. And

3
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:09,220
to stay on topic, I want to say: big spoiler
alert!

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:13,560
If you watch the rest of this movie, you
know how to do it. So if you still want to

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,580
try it,

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,880
this is your second chance - stop
watching this now,

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,119
download the spreadsheet and try to see if
you can do it for yourself!

8
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,239
It will really be a lot more fun than
watching me just explaining it.

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,100
Okay, you're still here,

10
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:32,007
I guess you've done your homework, so
let's see how I solved this problem

11
00:00:32,007 --> 00:00:35,727
using a spreadsheet. Here's our database, or
our spreadsheet,

12
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,000
the little version where we just have
a number of actors. So the first thing

13
00:00:40,004 --> 00:00:41,018
that we need,

14
00:00:41,018 --> 00:00:45,998
of course, is to determine who in our
spreadsheet is actually

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,980
Bacon. Well, that's pretty easy, we can
just use a conditional formula

16
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,002
where we say: is this actor equal to
Kevin Bacon?

17
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:57,391
If it is, he will have the Bacon number 1,
if he isn't,

18
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,940
we could say: then you have Bacon
number 0, but that's not

19
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,799
entirely accurate. Actually, the Bacon number
of someone

20
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,999
in step 1, who is not Kevin Bacon, is not 0,
but it's undefined.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,014
There's no way of connecting to
actor. So we

22
00:01:13,014 --> 00:01:17,774
use a little "-" (dash) for that, instead of 0,
which is mathematically just more

23
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:18,400
accurate,

24
00:01:18,409 --> 00:01:22,169
and it would also help us because
in the rest of the solution we're going to

25
00:01:22,169 --> 00:01:23,980
use mathematical functions

26
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:27,002
like the SUM and a MIN and if we have 0

27
00:01:27,007 --> 00:01:30,011
in there, it might mess things up. So,

28
00:01:30,011 --> 00:01:33,160
in one step the only one we can reach

29
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:36,054
is Kevin Bacon, so he has Bacon number 1,

30
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:41,078
and the rest we don't know yet. So based
on this, we can see how far we can go.

31
00:01:41,078 --> 00:01:46,318
Let's go back to the list of movies
and it's pretty easy to determine now

32
00:01:46,329 --> 00:01:52,024
which of the movies have someone in
them with a Bacon number that's not

33
00:01:52,024 --> 00:01:56,014
undefined. We can just do a VLOOKUP of
the list of actors,

34
00:01:56,014 --> 00:02:02,114
there we go. Of course we use FALSE,
because we're using a direct connection.

35
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,060
Don't forget: select this and hit F4,

36
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,055
and then we can drag this formula down,
and the movies that have Kevin Bacon

37
00:02:10,055 --> 00:02:14,081
in them will now have a 1 after them, for
instance Crazy Stupid Love

38
00:02:14,081 --> 00:02:20,014
has Kevin Bacon in it, so it gets 1. So,
what we would like to do now is

39
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:22,013
propagate this 1

40
00:02:22,013 --> 00:02:25,069
to the entire movie, so we can see who

41
00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:28,084
else in the movie will get the Bacon
number 2,

42
00:02:28,084 --> 00:02:32,024
because Kevin Bacon is in it. And what 
we like to have

43
00:02:32,025 --> 00:02:35,980
in the movie worksheet is a Bacon number
not of an actor,

44
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:39,800
but of a movie. And we can of course do
that again, with a VLOOKUP,

45
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,018
if we look here we can see who is in the
movie.

46
00:02:43,018 --> 00:02:48,838
And we use a little bit of a dirty trick 
for this, because we can use

47
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,920
the SUMIF

48
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,998
function. We just sum all the values

49
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:58,074
for a given movie and we sum the steps
that we currently have. And if we sum

50
00:02:58,074 --> 00:03:02,054
a 1 and two dashes ("-"), the result 
will be 1,

51
00:03:02,055 --> 00:03:06,475
and if we sum just a bunch of dashes
the result will be 0.

52
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:10,560
So this SUMIF will actually result

53
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,000
in 1 if someone in the movie has a Bacon
number,

54
00:03:14,018 --> 00:03:17,067
and will result in 0 if no one in

55
00:03:17,067 --> 00:03:21,003
the movie is connected to Kevin Bacon.
So if we drag this down,

56
00:03:21,003 --> 00:03:24,011
you see those two movies, Crazy Stupid
Love

57
00:03:24,011 --> 00:03:27,011
and Wild Things, have 1 and the
other movies have 0.

58
00:03:27,011 --> 00:03:30,045
So we are slowly getting there

59
00:03:30,045 --> 00:03:34,739
because we know now in one step
what actor,

60
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:37,999
Kevin Bacon, and what movies can I reach,

61
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,240
so we can continue this in the second
step. So now we want to have the correct

62
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,000
number,

63
00:03:45,002 --> 00:03:50,003
not just for the Kevin Bacon version of
the movie, but for all of the other

64
00:03:50,003 --> 00:03:50,843
actors

65
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,280
in the movie. We can do this again with
a VLOOKUP -

66
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,980
we're going to go to the movie worksheet,
VLOOKUP,

67
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:00,998
and we find the associated Bacon number

68
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,001
for the movie, and we can hit F4

69
00:04:05,003 --> 00:04:10,580
and then we can drag this down. So we are
close, but here we have zeroes,

70
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,980
because the VLOOKUP

71
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:15,980
in the other worksheet, the SUMIF
resulted in a 0, and that's not what we

72
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,380
want - we want to have a dash.

73
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:21,500
So let's see, if this VLOOKUP is equal
to a dash,

74
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,031
then the result should be

75
00:04:23,031 --> 00:04:26,871
another dash. Oh, I'm sorry if

76
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:30,419
it is equal to a 0, it should be another dash, 
and otherwise it should be equal to the 

77
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,600
VLOOKUP

78
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,740
but plus 1, because Kevin Bacon's

79
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:39,040
Bacon number is 1 and everyone who has
been in a movie with him

80
00:04:39,049 --> 00:04:43,980
should get the number plus 1. So now
we have the right numbers

81
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:47,006
in the right line for all the actors, and
if we just

82
00:04:47,016 --> 00:04:51,356
get this in in the actor worksheet, we will
have the correct calculation.

83
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,669
So there we go, Step2. What we can
just do

84
00:04:55,669 --> 00:04:59,001
is use another VLOOKUP and we're
going to look for the

85
00:04:59,001 --> 00:05:04,040
actor and now we take that fourth column,
the D column, because there we have -

86
00:05:04,049 --> 00:05:08,089
everyone who has been in a movie with
Kevin Bacon will have 2,

87
00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:11,499
and the others will have a dash. So 
this is

88
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,100
almost correct, we see that those

89
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,980
people that have 2 are indeed

90
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:21,025
the ones who have been in a movie with
Kevin Bacon.

91
00:05:21,025 --> 00:05:24,980
So, it almost works. There's just one thing 
that's still a little bit strange, is that

92
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:27,993
in the second step Kevin Bacon now has 2,

93
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,099
and that's because we went from him

94
00:05:31,099 --> 00:05:34,076
to Crazy Stupid Love and back, but that's
not really fair,

95
00:05:34,076 --> 00:05:38,996
because he already had the Bacon number 1.
So what we really need to do is -

96
00:05:39,025 --> 00:05:40,007
take the minimum

97
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:44,987
of what we have already calculated and
what is in this

98
00:05:45,022 --> 00:05:49,022
extra step. And you see that in the
previous video I forgot to hit

99
00:05:49,022 --> 00:05:54,400
F4 there, so I've corrected that now as well.
So we see Kevin Bacon now has 1,

100
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,849
all the others have 2, but unfortunately,
because of the use of the

101
00:05:57,849 --> 00:06:01,849
MIN operation, we now get an error
value (#VALUE!).

102
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:05,860
I don't know why this is, but if you have
2 MINs, if there are in

103
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:09,439
different worksheets, apparently Excel
gives an error. So we add

104
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:12,058
IFERROR around it, if we get an error 
then we

105
00:06:12,058 --> 00:06:16,998
write a dash, and otherwise we use the
MIN. So,

106
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,063
we have done it - now, for one step, we've 
calculated:

107
00:06:20,063 --> 00:06:25,860
1 - Kevin Bacon, and everyone that has
been in a movie with Kevin Bacon now has

108
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:26,860
Bacon number 2.

109
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:30,139
We would still need to continue this
entire step

110
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:33,154
another time if we would want to do it for
three steps and

111
00:06:33,289 --> 00:06:36,009
for four steps and for five steps.

112
00:06:36,009 --> 00:06:41,034
So, can we do this? Yes, we can! You've
just seen me do it.

113
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:45,974
However, if you continue this calculation,
and I encourage you to try to continue it by

114
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,780
yourself,

115
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:50,031
then you'll see that for three steps you
will need

116
00:06:50,031 --> 00:06:55,032
8 auxiliary columns, 8 conditional formulas,
3 MINs and

117
00:06:55,032 --> 00:06:59,912
8 VLOOKUPs. So that's maybe not
really what you want

118
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:04,160
and then you're just at three steps. And I've
looked it up, and apparently the highest

119
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:04,960
number that

120
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,012
an actor in Hollywood has is 12, so if you
want to continue this calculation for

121
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:10,015
12 steps,

122
00:07:10,015 --> 00:07:13,047
then we need like 25 VLOOKUPs.

123
00:07:13,047 --> 00:07:16,627
So, probably we're not really on the right
path here,

124
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,160
but it is possible.
