1
00:00:00,057 --> 00:00:03,032
So we've calculated the Bacon number in
the previous video

2
00:00:03,032 --> 00:00:07,112
in Excel which is possible but takes us a
lot.

3
00:00:07,149 --> 00:00:11,729
I'm not afraid to admit that it took me
about five hours to come up with this

4
00:00:11,729 --> 00:00:12,600
solution,

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,059
and I am quite handy with Excel,

6
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:20,025
so this is not a solution you want. Actually,
I hope that

7
00:00:20,025 --> 00:00:25,939
in your mind you have something like
this: WIIIIEEEEE, The No Excel alarm!

8
00:00:25,939 --> 00:00:29,003
If in your daily life you're making a
solution

9
00:00:29,003 --> 00:00:33,013
that takes you more and 10 VLOOKUPs
to put together,

10
00:00:33,013 --> 00:00:36,052
then something is off. You should
really be thinking:

11
00:00:36,052 --> 00:00:39,852
am I using the right tool for the job,

12
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:44,051
is this still the best way to do it? So
of course then the question arises -

13
00:00:44,057 --> 00:00:48,297
what should we use? What is a better tool
to use

14
00:00:48,309 --> 00:00:52,369
then a spreadsheet? What about
programming?

15
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:57,000
Isn't it easier if you use a programming
language, because with programming you

16
00:00:57,007 --> 00:00:58,055
are not limited to

17
00:00:58,055 --> 00:01:02,006
the rows and columns of Excel, you can
do anything you want.

18
00:01:02,006 --> 00:01:07,746
This might be a good solution for a
problem where Excel is not entirely fit.

19
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:12,000
However, I'm a little bit like a Hobbit,

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,058
I like to stay in my comfortable Shire,
I don't want to leave my

21
00:01:16,058 --> 00:01:20,958
comfortable Excel home, to go to a
programming language that

22
00:01:21,049 --> 00:01:26,809
I'm not familiar with. Of course we could
use VB.

23
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,980
Visual Basic for Applications is a
programming language that is embedded

24
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,520
right in Excel, maybe you've been working
with it before,

25
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,999
and this you can use as a programming
language to

26
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:41,015
automate your spreadsheets, to
calculate things

27
00:01:41,015 --> 00:01:44,995
that you cannot do with a formula. This is a
possibility, if you have been working

28
00:01:45,007 --> 00:01:46,035
with VBA before,

29
00:01:46,035 --> 00:01:49,079
I challenge you again to try to solve
the Bacon puzzle

30
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:53,017
with VBA, this should be a lot easier

31
00:01:53,017 --> 00:01:57,417
than using formulas. However, that's not
what we are going to use in this

32
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,020
course.

33
00:01:58,025 --> 00:02:01,805
What we are going to use to automate
our spreadsheet is a language called

34
00:02:01,805 --> 00:02:07,014
Python. So, why Python? One of the reasons
that I like to use Python is

35
00:02:07,014 --> 00:02:09,834
that it's currently the number one
programming language

36
00:02:09,849 --> 00:02:12,039
taught at universities. So in a few years

37
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:16,079
there'll be lots of people around the
world they're really know how to program

38
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,000
in Python.

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,360
It's also quite easy to learn, you'll see
that in

40
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:25,000
examples in this video, that the syntax,
the way you write in programming language,

41
00:02:25,003 --> 00:02:30,343
is quite easy, and also there's a big
ecosystem around Python, that means a lot of

42
00:02:30,343 --> 00:02:35,000
small Python programs, called libraries,
exist in the world

43
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
to solve problems, and if you have such a
problem

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,066
you don't need to write in Python yourself,
you can just use the programs

45
00:02:41,066 --> 00:02:45,012
other people have already created. So
these are all reasons

46
00:02:45,012 --> 00:02:50,013
that I prefer Python over VBA, but VBA
is also a good programming language that

47
00:02:50,013 --> 00:02:52,513
you can certainly use for this type of
problems.

48
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,400
But if I want to use Python,

49
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,259
do I have to go away from my spreadsheet
home? You can.

50
00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:05,023
You can use Python totally separate from Excel, 
but then you have to do a lot of learning,

51
00:03:05,023 --> 00:03:10,663
you have to migrate your data from a
spreadsheet probably to a text file, so...

52
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:14,814
I don't want that, I want to have
a Python and Excel,

53
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,860
both of them. Luckily, there is a solution.

54
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:23,049
There is a cool program that's called DataNitro
that allows you to use Python

55
00:03:23,049 --> 00:03:28,649
in Excel. Much like VBA, you can just
script your spreadsheet with Python.

56
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:32,020
This solution unfortunately is only
available for Windows,

57
00:03:32,026 --> 00:03:37,000
but there are alternatives for Mac and for
Linux, we'll put links to the alternatives

58
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,299
on the course page. So let's try to use

59
00:03:40,299 --> 00:03:44,015
DataNitro, here you can see it, if
you had a keen eye

60
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:47,995
you've seen that in the screenshots
of one of the previous videos

61
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,640
there was a DataNitro plugin. So,
it's right there in Excel,

62
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,038
and if you go there, if you go to the 
worksheet, let's click it,

63
00:03:56,038 --> 00:04:01,778
if you click Python Shell, you get something
like a calculator where you

64
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,800
can type formulas, like 3 + 5,

65
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:08,009
much like you can type formulas in Excel,
but you can also refer to

66
00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:12,419
the spreadsheet. You can do something
like C2 + 5,

67
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:16,936
but you don't do C2 as you do it in
Excel, you have to directly call

68
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,199
the value. So you see,

69
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:21,087
say, give me the cell on C2, the value,

70
00:04:21,087 --> 00:04:24,960
and add 5 to it. And it's not just
reading,

71
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,960
you can also

72
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,976
write to the spreadsheet, as you see me 
do here. Let's put "Hello!"

73
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:33,048
in A1 and then you see that not just
A1 has changed,

74
00:04:33,055 --> 00:04:37,535
but also all the values that depend on
it. So you change a value and then

75
00:04:37,539 --> 00:04:41,065
the spreadsheet calculation kicks in,
and everything is recalculated.

76
00:04:41,065 --> 00:04:45,580
But let's quickly put it back to Kevin Bacon
because, otherwise, our nice

77
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:46,960
Bacon calculator is messed up.

78
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:51,064
So this seems to be a good solution that
might help us

79
00:04:51,074 --> 00:04:56,414
to solve our Bacon problem with Python,
and that's what we're going to do

80
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,080
in the next video.
