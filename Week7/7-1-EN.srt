00:00:00,074 --> 00:00:04,034
In previous videos we've talked about
problems with spreadsheets and how to

2
00:00:04,036 --> 00:00:05,596
address them with testing.

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:10,000
But spreadsheets just aren't always the
right solutions -

4
00:00:10,004 --> 00:00:14,013
there are problems that you can come up
with in your

5
00:00:14,049 --> 00:00:17,076
work that are just not solvable with a
spreadsheet.

6
00:00:17,076 --> 00:00:21,033
And those are the types of problems that
we're going to talk about today -

7
00:00:21,033 --> 00:00:26,073
when not to use a spreadsheet. So over
the past few weeks you've learned a lot

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:26,920
about me

9
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,920
and the things I like, like teaching and crafts
beer

10
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:33,400
but there is one of my hobbies that we
haven't talked about, and that's going to

11
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,053
the movies.

12
00:00:34,053 --> 00:00:37,071
I really like the movies! I even have a
subscription

13
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,960
to the movie theater in my city that I can
go to all movies

14
00:00:41,037 --> 00:00:44,997
unlimited. So this week's exercises will be
all about

15
00:00:45,005 --> 00:00:49,001
a little movie database I've made in a
spreadsheet. Well, we have movies,

16
00:00:49,001 --> 00:00:53,320
the studios that made the movies, the
rating of the movie, so when you can see

17
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,000
it,

18
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:57,620
the year that the movie has been
released in, and

19
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:03,739
the type of movie, the genre, so the
action, adventure... And we have 

20
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:04,559
a lot of data.

21
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,052
In addition to the movies in our
database we also have actors

22
00:01:08,052 --> 00:01:11,972
and movies that they have played in. So,
here you can see that Andre 3000

23
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,015
has played

24
00:01:13,024 --> 00:01:18,025
in a Volcano movie. So it is a nice
little database for movie information

25
00:01:18,025 --> 00:01:20,005
that we can analyse. So there are a lot

26
00:01:20,006 --> 00:01:24,940
of analyses we can do on this data.
For instance, we can analyse the

27
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:26,899
studios that actors have worked for.

28
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:30,579
We could be interested in the question:
"what actor in our database

29
00:01:30,579 --> 00:01:35,003
has worked for the most different, the
the highest number of different studios?"

30
00:01:35,003 --> 00:01:39,483
So we can get the information in
from a studio with a VLOOKUP,

31
00:01:39,483 --> 00:01:43,018
this should all be easy for you if
you've watched all of the videos.

32
00:01:43,018 --> 00:01:46,067
So we add a VLOOKUP, and we get the
information of

33
00:01:46,067 --> 00:01:50,052
every studio associated with a movie.
And then we can select

34
00:01:50,052 --> 00:01:54,392
all of that data, there it is, we can select
all of this data

35
00:01:54,549 --> 00:01:57,078
and add it to a PivotTable. This
should also

36
00:01:57,078 --> 00:02:01,238
be a piece of cake if you've watched
all videos. So,

37
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:05,000
we add our data to the data model,
because we're going to want to use a

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,420
Distinct Count

39
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,000
to calculate the different
number of studios

40
00:02:09,002 --> 00:02:13,111
that people have worked for. So, here's
our PivotTable,

41
00:02:13,129 --> 00:02:16,037
we drag in the name of the actor, there it is,

42
00:02:16,037 --> 00:02:19,597
and then we drag in the studio,

43
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,080
and we get the number of studios that people have 
worked for. And there's one little

44
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,620
thing that we still need to change, it's:

45
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:28,980
we need to go to PivotTable
properties and we say "we don't want to

46
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:29,980
have the count,

47
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:33,024
but we want to scroll down, we want to
have the Distinct Count".

48
00:02:33,031 --> 00:02:38,011
And if this is done calculating... Takes 
a while...

49
00:02:38,015 --> 00:02:42,031
Now we can sort and then we can see that
Christopher Lee has worked for the

50
00:02:42,031 --> 00:02:46,511
highest number of different studios, I
think it's 42.

51
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,560
Yes, there it is! It's 42!

52
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,549
So we have a lot of data in our database
and we can analyse it in different ways,

53
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:58,558
using VLOOKUP and using PivotTable,
we know that by now.

54
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:02,026
But let's try to ask ourself a different
question:

55
00:03:02,026 --> 00:03:05,935
we would like to know for all of the actors
not the number of studios that they have

56
00:03:06,169 --> 00:03:08,079
worked for, but we'd like to know for
every actor

57
00:03:08,079 --> 00:03:15,319
their Bacon number. I thought Bacon number
was like a very familiar concept,

58
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:19,720
I did the same exercise in my class, here 
in Delft, for 40 students,

59
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:22,956
and I said: who knows what a Bacon number
is? And, like

60
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:27,399
two hands went up... So apparently, it's a
little bit of a movie-geek thing, so I'll

61
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,960
explain to you what it is.

62
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,047
An actor's Bacon number is the number of
steps that an

63
00:03:32,056 --> 00:03:38,216
actor is removed from Kevin Bacon. So
Kevin Bacon himself has Bacon number 1,

64
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,639
and someone that has played in a movie
with him, for instance, 

65
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:46,349
Ed Harris in Apollo 13, he will
have Bacon number 2.

66
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:49,361
Someone that has played in a movie with Ed Harris,

67
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:52,999
like Nicolas Cage in one of my favourite
movies, The Rock,

68
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,015
will have Bacon number 3, because his
distance to Kevin Bacon

69
00:03:57,015 --> 00:04:02,595
is 2 hops via Ed Harris. So in this way
we can chart everyone who has played in

70
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,460
movies

71
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:09,199
based on their distance to Kevin Bacon. So
the number of hops, the number of steps

72
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:10,459
from Kevin Bacon

73
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:15,473
defines the Bacon number. We should be
able to calculate this information in

74
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,079
our little movie database, right? Because we
have the information -

75
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:22,003
we know who has played in what movie,
but

76
00:04:22,003 --> 00:04:23,460
how to get this

77
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:28,020
out? How are we going to process the
information in such a way that we get a

78
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,000
nice little list

79
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,081
of each actor with their Bacon number?

80
00:04:32,081 --> 00:04:36,001
So I challenge you before you watch the
rest of the videos

81
00:04:36,008 --> 00:04:39,580
to try this. And don't try it on this huge
database,

82
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:43,169
but try it on this little database. We
will put this online,

83
00:04:43,169 --> 00:04:48,860
in the course website, it's just easier
to play with such a little spreadsheet

84
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,580
than with an entire list of

85
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:55,040
thousands and thousands of actors. So,
please don't watch the next video yet,

86
00:04:55,045 --> 00:05:00,046
download this, play with it, and try to
see if you can come up with a way

87
00:05:00,046 --> 00:05:04,046
to analyse the Bacon number for each
actor. Good luck!
